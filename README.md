# Red Hat Community Website

Welcome to the Red Hat Community Website! This site is the home for information about the Open Source and Standards team, its constituent  communities, and everything you need to get started with upstream projects supported by Red Hat.

This was the source repository for the website, and the home of all documentation, community content, and release management content.
It is now managed on a WordPress instance.

This repository is now only used to generate calendar events which are then pushed to the WordPress site.
More info on the deployment and generation can be found here: https://gitlab.com/osas/community-cage-infra-ansible/
