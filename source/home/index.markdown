---

Red Hat's mission is to be the catalyst in communities of customers, contributors, and partners creating better technology (the open source way)[http://theopensourceway.org].





Free and open source creates better software. That's why Red Hat collaborates to build better technology the open source way, regardless of where it is hosted or who started it.





We collaborate, and the best technology wins. That's good -- not just for Red Hat, but for everyone.
