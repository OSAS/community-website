### Key Message

![](/images/branding/image12.png)

oVirt provides datacenter virtualization, including a kernel-based virtual machine (KVM) hypervisor running on the Linux kernel, and a virtualization management system based on Fedora or CentOS and the WildFly Application Server.

### Visual Style

oVirt has a mostly light overall feel, with headlines and accents in the green color. You can also use light grays for illustrations on brochures. If you need more impact for presentations or event booths, you can use a green background and white logo.

#### Font and Text Styles

![Screenshot from 2016-03-04 11-12-42.png](/images/branding/image17.png)

oVirt uses two font families; Venturis Sans ADF for headlines and Source Sans Pro for normal text content. Both fonts are free and available for Fedora.

Source Sans Pro can be installed with the Software application and it is also found in [Google Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts%23UsePlace:use/Collection:Source%2BSans%2BPro).

Venturis Sans is also included in Fedora, but the Software installer does not find it since it is part of the TeX publishing framework, and thus not listed as a software package by itself. But you can use the command  “sudo dnf install texlive-venturisadf” on the Terminal to install it by its own.

#### Colors

The oVirt logo is green but the “Virt” part can be white if the logo is placed on a green background. Just make sure the “o” has legible contrast against the background.

### Messaging

oVirt works closely with RDO, a community-driven OpenStack distribution and ManageIQ, which provides cloud management and orchestration across multiple hypervisors, public cloud providers, and OpenStack. oVirt also is integrated with Gluster for file-based storage and Ceph for block storage.
