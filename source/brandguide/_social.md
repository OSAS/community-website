## Social Media Channels

At this time, OSAS projects and adjunct open source projects are present on one of three social media platforms: Twitter, Facebook, and Google+. Social media channels are managed by their respective community leads and the community analyst. Adjunct social media channels are managed by their respective projects. For more information, refer to the “Tactics” section of this branding guide.

## Social Media Guidelines

Information and communication in the open source ecosystem has become increasingly more social, if such a thing is possible. It is increasingly important to use social media tools to connect to users, contributors, and allies within the broad open source community.

Understanding who is reaching out to OSAS and the projects it supports is the first step in building a social media strategy. Is it users, developers, or potential partners? How do they interact with our online presence? How is the OSAS brand perceived and discussed, particularly in relation to Red Hat as well as its participating projects?

As OSAS listens, it will also be in the process of sharing its own voice with the community, building conversations and content that can keep people engaged and listening to what OSAS has to say. This will strengthen existing relationships or build new ones.

This social media plan is meant to codify the plan to converse and listen to the people OSAS and its respective projects want to reach.

Learn more about [Red Hat’s social media policies](https://mojo.redhat.com/community/about-red-hat/messaging-index/social-media-guidelines).

### Strategy

The social media strategy for OSAS is two-fold.

First, a concerted effort to engage people on existing social media channels should be undertaken. This has the immediate benefit of raising the chatter about OSAS and its projects on those social media channels and increasing our exposure overall.

Second, content will be produced on the Community site at community.redhat.com to be shared and commented upon within the various social media channels with the ultimate intention of driving traffic back to the Community site.

Getting traffic to the Community site enables OSAS to better measure the impact its projects and content pages have on our audience and affords us prime opportunities to directly connect with visitors. These direct connections could direct existing users to help and potentially form new opportunities with potential users.

Above all, the overall tone of the content and our message will be as open source and upstream-oriented as possible. OSAS and its projects will be sources of reasoned information and thought leadership within the Linux community and the broader technology sectors each project touches.

Another element of the strategy will be to work with any upstream project’s existing social media contributors to build their brand and follow existing community norms. In this case, OSAS will coordinate with contributors to help them promote their upstream project, using metrics and constructive methods to enhance community messaging for that project.

#### Goals and Objectives

The goals and objectives of the OSAS social media plan are:

- Increase awareness of all OSAS projects and services
- Establish members of the OSAS projects as thought leaders in their respective fields
- Build rapport and interest among members of the media
- Drive traffic to the Red Hat Community site to increase awareness of how all projects work together

### Tactics

To deliver on these goals and objectives, a broad approach to social media and content generation will be undertaken, through a variety of outlets.

#### Channels

Ideally, all channels will be jointly managed by the Community Analyst and the Community Liaison for each OSAS project, where applicable. If the Analyst is not a member of that project, or the project is not part of OSAS, the Analyst will work with a project’s existing governance and social media participant to enhance social media messaging for that project.

The look and feel of these channels will remain the same, to maintain the independent nature of each project.

Community Site. The main OSAS Community site will be a major destination for anyone interested in OSAS- and Red Hat-related projects, as well . Besides our blog, it will feature a master events calendar as well as real-time metrics from all OSAS communities (provided by Bitergia).

Twitter. The microblogging site will be a core component of each OSAS project's social media outreach. The audience will be the most varied, and because of the responsiveness of the messaging platform, a lot of conversations can be held on Twitter.

Facebook. Though it waned in popularity as a social media outlet for technologists, increasing effort should be expended on Facebook outreach. The North American audience is mostly community members and users and in APAC and LatAm, the platform with also popular with technologists, all of which are an important audience for OSAS's social media strategy.

Google+. This channel is still growing, and has the potential of being a great touch point to the technically minded and development audiences. Eventually, it should become a general-audience platform that will rival or surpass Facebook in importance. Also of note, it is planned that we will make further use of the Google Hangouts feature to generate video content that will be cross-posted to the YouTube channel.

YouTube. We are currently under-utilizing this channel, and it is hoped the injection of new original content will help get more traffic on this channel.

Blue Jeans. We can make use of the Blue Jeans service for video broadcasts. Currently we can implement 100-participant broadcasts/meetings, as well as broadcast up to 2000-participant Events.

Podcasts. OSAS should produce (at least) a monthly series of podcasts related to the areas of interest for OSAS and its participating projects. These will have a less-formal format and should be available for the general public.

#### Social Media Content

Content on all of the channels listed above will be ecumenical in nature, with a focus on upstream OSAS projects and the topics in which its projects lead: cloud computing, Linux, containers, virtualization, IT management, storage, and advanced networking.

Content will include original content, to be hosted on the Community site, and will include blogs, technical articles, and success stories, as well as multimedia content. Links back to this content will be posted on the appropriate social media channels.

Aggregated content of interest from project sites will also appear on the Community portal. Broader related content will also be aggregated on the appropriate social media channels.
