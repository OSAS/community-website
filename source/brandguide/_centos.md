CentOS has a dark blue “science fiction” -like visual style with a circuit board pattern and a gradient to darker blue, with white text laid on top. The yellow color from the logo has also been used as an accent color with designs using the light-on-dark color scheme, like on the website.

#### Font and Text Styles

Two font families are utilized by CentOS. [Exo](https://www.google.com/fonts%23UsePlace:use/Collection:Exo) for headlines and [Source Sans Pro](https://www.google.com/fonts%23UsePlace:use/Collection:Source%2BSans%2BPro) for normal text.

Both fonts are freely licensed and can be downloaded from the Google Fonts service. On Fedora, Source Sans Pro can be installed with the Software application.
