# Red Hat Community Projects: A brief style guide

From the [Red Hat Brand Standards](http://brand.redhat.com/logos/communitylogos/):

> “Red Hat wouldn’t exist without open source communities … These are brands we care about, brands we support, but not brands we own. Red Hat doesn’t define their standards. We just lend a hand whenever possible.”

This document details the visual style and identity of a number of our upstream and downstream community projects. Just like the communities themselves, the exact set of projects we work with is subject to change. When you have an opportunity to work with open source communities, and have questions about branding, the brand standards has another piece of advice: “Get involved. Contact an active member to find out how you can help.”

## Keep Things Open

Since we are helping communities that work through open collaboration, we need to avoid building boundaries for other designers. Always strive to use free and open elements in your designs - images that you have created yourself, and fonts that are released under the SIL Open Font License. This way others can build on your work without having to fear breaking copyright or licensing agreements. [Open Font Library](https://fontlibrary.org/) and [Google Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts) are great resources for finding free fonts.

Also remember to use open file formats like SVG so your files can be opened and edited by others using open source tools like Inkscape. While open source tools like GIMP can open images in Photoshop PSD format, there are some limitations with certain layer modes and object types. For this reason, also think though your designs and try to think how you could best share your assets in case someone needs to create derived works from them. You are not just fulfilling a design assignment, you are also helping a project shape its identity, and the community needs to be able to build on top of your work.
