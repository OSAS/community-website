Open Sans is packaged for Fedora - you'll need to install the texlive-opensans package. Open Sans may also be downloaded from the [Open Sans website](http://www.opensans.com/). Montserrat may be downloaded from [Font Squirrel website](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/montserrat). Both fonts are openly licensed and freely distributable.
