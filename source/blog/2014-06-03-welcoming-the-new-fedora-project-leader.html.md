After more than two years' service as Fedora Project Leader (FPL), [Robyn Bergeron announced that she is stepping down](http://robyn.io/2014/05/19/thanks-to-you-im-much-obliged/) to pass the reins to a new FPL. Today, Robyn [announced her successor](http://robyn.io/2014/06/03/new-fpl/), Matthew Miller.

Matthew has been active in Fedora for (as Robyn puts it) "since the 'literal dawn of Fedora time'", from organizing FUDCons around Boston University to being driving force behind [the Fedora.Next initiative](http://fedoramagazine.org/fedora-present-and-future-a-fedora-next-2014-update-part-i-why/) and the Fedora Cloud Workgroup. Cloud is a theme of FPLs of late, with Robyn being instrumental in [starting and running the Cloud SIG back in 2010](http://www.linux-magazine.com/Online/News/Beyond-FUDCon-with-Robyn-Bergeron-Fedora-Program-Manager).

## The FPL Role

The FPL role has been around, in one form or another, since the dawn of Fedora. To date, the position has been held by seven people: Michael K. Johnson, Cristian Gafton, Greg DeKoenigsberg, Max Spevack, Paul W. Frields, Jared Smith, and Robyn.

The FPL role is described on the Fedora Project wiki as being "ultimately accountable for everything that happens within Fedora and in particular is responsible for maintaining Red Hat’s relationship with Fedora, and vice-versa."

Fedora is, of course, much bigger than the FPL. It's driven by thousands of contributors around the world who file bugs, create patches, write docs, make artwork, work on translation, and all of the other work that's required to keep the project humming. But the FPL is in a unique position to influence and observe Fedora.

Matthew, having been active in several areas of Fedora for such a long time, is off to a good running start to take the baton and run with it. You can read his [thoughts on taking the post](http://fedoramagazine.org/?p=1772) on Fedora Magazine.

## Thanks, Robyn!

Robyn [stepped up to the FPL role in February of 2012](http://robyn.io/2012/02/07/meat-your-new-fp/). I've had the good fortune to work with Robyn [as a reporter covering Fedora](https://www.linux.com/learn/tutorials/544337:the-torch-is-passed-talking-with-new-fedora-project-leader-robyn-bergeron),  working for another company participating in open source projects that interact with Fedora, and (finally) as a co-worker at Red Hat. 

She's done the Fedora community a lot of good, and I'm looking forward to seeing what she does next. Thanks Robyn, for your work as FPL, and good luck to Matthew taking over the reins!
