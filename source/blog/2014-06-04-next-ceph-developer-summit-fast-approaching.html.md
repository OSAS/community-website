The countdown is on for the June 24th Ceph Summit, when Ceph core developers and the
community can [get together](http://ceph.com/community/ceph-developer-summit-gh/) (virtually) to discuss what's coming in the next Ceph release. Although we're sticking to our quarterly schedule, this summit will be slightly different from previous summits. 

Usually we hold a summit right around the time of a major release (Dumpling, Emperor, Firefly); however, the Firefly release was held up for several weeks, so this summit will still be discussing work going into Giant and looking ahead to Hammer.

##Blueprints

Because we'll be reviewing all of the in-flight work for Giant, any [existing blueprints](https://wiki.ceph.com/Planning/Blueprints/Giant) only need to be updated with the latest status; however, if you have new work that you would like to get in to Giant or to start
working on with an eye toward Hammer, you should create a [new blueprint](https://wiki.ceph.com/Planning/Blueprints/Submissions) to ensure it gets a session at CDS.  Blueprint submission is open now and we will accept new blueprints for the summit until June 16th. Blueprints submitted after June 16 will be treated as interim blueprints and discussed outside of the CDS setting.

##The Summit

Although staying on top of in-flight work for Giant is important, our goal for the summit is to address the many new things that are going on in the world of Ceph development. For example, we recently announced the [open source release of Calamari](http://ceph.com/community/ceph-calamari-goes-open-source/), the Ceph management platform. We want to make sure we take time to introduce the platform and help community developers get up to speed on all the moving pieces. In addition to Calamari, we will also be discussing the following topics:

* Wiki IA Overhaul
* Technical Component Leads (as a part of the Ceph Technical Committee)
* Foundation Update
* Cloud Update (OpenStack, CloudStack, OpenNebula, etc.)
* OS/Container Update (CentOS SIG, CoreOS, Docker)
* CephFS Update (CohortFS, community work, tech lead, etc.)
* Reassess work from the Giant summit

As you can see, there is a lot going on in the world of Ceph.

##Attending the Summit

Even if you aren't a technical contributor to Ceph, attending CDS or watching the post-event videos can be helpful. The summit has historically been held via Google Hangouts "On Air" (broadcast and recorded via YouTube), so tuning in and watching the discussion unfold on the [Ceph G+ page](https://plus.google.com/+Cephstorage/) is easy. We are evaluating a couple of potential new options that would be more cross-platform friendly, but either way we'll be able to have recordings for those who don't make it.  If you would like to participate, you can also join the back-channel discussion in #ceph-summit on irc.oftc.net. 

On June 20th, we'll announce the Ceph Summit agenda, so [check back](http://ceph.com/community/ceph-developer-summit-gh/) for the details. Information from past CDS events, including links to blueprints, videos, and etherpads, is kept on the [Ceph wiki]("https://wiki.ceph.com/Planning/CDS).

We look forward to another great CDS with our amazing community. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me via the [usual Ceph channels](http://ceph.com/community/ceph-developer-summit-gh/) or directly at my fancy new [Red Hat email address](mailto:pmcgarry@redhat.com).  See you all there!
