![](blog/rhsummit_button.jpg)Last week I had the privilege of going to Paris for the OpenStack 'Kilo' Summit. Now that OpenStack Juno has been released, the Kilo Summit is held to plan the roadmap for the next release, [Kilo](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Kilo_Release_Schedule).

Releases are named in alphabetical order, after something near the location of the summit. In this case, the [International Prototype Kilgram](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram#International_prototype_kilogram), which is stored in SÃ¨vres, just outside of Paris.

This is the third Summit that I've attended - the first two being in Hong Kong and Atlanta - and I'm always impressed with the sheer quantity of content jammed into the time, the depth of those sessions, and of the questions that attendees ask. This is a deep technical conference, and the attendees are the people who are actually doing the work in this space.

![](blog/rh_booth.jpg) Red Hat engineers were involved in presenting more than 20 sessions, which run the first three days of the conference. The second half of the event is the design summit, where the various project teams discuss features and enhancements that will be developed for the upcoming release.

![](blog/rhsummit_hats.jpg){:align="right"} I spent most of the event manning  the RDO demo pod at the Red Hat booth, where we had a steady stream of people asking everything from "What is RDO?," to deep technical questions about a spectrum of OpenStack topics. We gave away hundreds of RDO tshirts and red fedoras.

We also had several brochures that described how RDO works, and how it relates to the various projects that orbit it: 

* [Red Hat Knows OpenStack](http://openstack.redhat.com/images/brochure/redhat_knows_openstack-portrait-A4.pdf)

* [OpenStack Runs on Red hat](http://openstack.redhat.com/images/brochure/openstack_runs_on_redhat-portrait-A4.pdf)

* [Red Hat Works with OpenStack](http://openstack.redhat.com/images/brochure/redhat_works_with_openstack-portrait-A4.pdf)

![](blog/rh_booth2.jpg) The high point of the conference for me was the RDO Community Meetup. We weren't able to get a room for the meetup at a time that worked for everyone, so we held it in a corner of the exhibit hall. Although hearing at times was hard, the meeting was very valuable, with many members of the RDO community stepping up to work on parts of RDO. We also discussed the steps needed to move some of the hidden parts of RDO out into the light, where more people can participate. I'm hopeful that this will start a new chapter in the RDO project, with greater involvement by the community of users, and the ability for the project to move in directions that are of interest to the wider community.

In addition to the summit's technical content during the day, every evening had some kind of social event. The eventing events provided opportunities to meet with colleagues old and new, and to connect in a more casual setting to forge the relationships across companies that enable OpenStack collaboration to work as well as it does. These events were held in venues across Paris, giving us a chance to see different parts of this great city.

Over the coming days, we'll start seeing some writeups of the design summit, and this will give us a clearer idea of what we'll be talking about six months from now when Kilo releases and we start looking forward to the 'L' release and the next summit in Vancouver. I'm already looking forward to [OpenStack Summit Vancouver](https://www.openstack.org/summit/vancouver-2015/). Each conference highlights for me things that we could do differently - better - at the next event, and planning has already started. Hope to see you there!
