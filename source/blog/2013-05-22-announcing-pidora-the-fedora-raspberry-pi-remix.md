Today Fedora and the Seneca Centre for Development of Open Technology (CDOT) are announcing the release of Pidora 18 ([pidora.ca](http://pidora.ca)), an optimized Fedora remix for the Raspberry Pi. It's based on a brand new build of Fedora for the ARMv6 architecture with greater speed and includes packages from the Fedora 18 package set. It's also the launch of the Pidora name.

### Features

  * Almost all of the Fedora 18 package set available via yum (thousands of packages were built from the official Fedora repository and made available online)

  * Compiled specifically to take advantage of the hardware already built into the Raspberry Pi

  * Graphical first-boot configuration (with additional modules specifically made for the Raspberry Pi)

  * Compact initial image size (for fast downloads) and auto-resize (for maximum storage afterwards)

  * Auto-swap creation available to allow for larger memory usage

  * C, Python, & Perl programming languages available & included in the SD card image

  * Initial release of headless mode can be used with setups lacking a monitor or display

  * IP address information can be read over the speakers and flashed with the LED light

  * For graphical operation, Gedit text editor can be used with plugins (python console, file manager, syntax highlighting) to serve as a mini-graphical IDE

  * For console operation, easy-to-use text editors are included (nled, nano, vi) plus Midnight Commander for file management

  * Includes libraries capable of supporting external hardware such as motors and robotics (via GPIO, I2C, SPI)
