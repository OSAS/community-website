In the open source software world, every day can be a test day, but there’s plenty to be gained when community members converge on an IRC channel to nick themselves on a project’s cutting edge. This month, there’s a handful of test days on tap:

### RDO: February 4th & 5th

Following the OpenStack Icehouse milestone 2 release, the RDO project is holding a pair of test days on [February 4th and 5th](http://openstack.redhat.com/forum/discussion/965/icehouse-milestone-2-test-day-feb-4-5). For more information, and to indicate that you’ll be participating, head to the [test day page](http://openstack.redhat.com/RDO_test_day_Icehouse_milestone_2) on the RDO wiki.

### Gluster: February 14th - 16th

The beta3 packages for Gluster 3.5 are expected to hit FTP this week, with a GlusterFest testing weekend to follow. This one is still somewhat TBD, so check the [Gluster project site](http://www.gluster.org/) and [mailing lists](http://www.gluster.org/interact/mailinglists/) for updates and confirmation.

### oVirt: February 11th and February 19th

[oVirt 3.4](/blog/2014/01/ovirt-3.4-all-about-easier-installation-administration/) is nigh, with a [projected general availability](http://www.ovirt.org/OVirt_3.4_release_management) date of February 24th.

Leading up to the final 3.4 release, there’s a pair of test days scheduled for shaking out as many issues as possible ahead of the release. For more information, see the [3.4 test days page](http://www.ovirt.org/OVirt_3.4_TestDay) on the oVirt project wiki.

### Fedora QA Tips & Fedora.next

The Fedora Project isn’t holding any test days for February, due in part to a longer-than-normal lead-in period for [Fedora.next](http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Fedora.next), an umbrella term for the "shape of Fedora in the post-F20 future."

However, Fedora QA titan Adam Williamson offered up a great list of [suggested testing activities](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/test/2014-January/120167.html) during the pre-F21 lull that’s well worth reading and acting on.

And, speaking of Fedora.next and Adam Williamson, Adam wrote a very [insightful post](https://www.happyassassin.net/2014/01/31/good-morning-bugfixing-and-thinking-about-fedora-next/) about the new initiative and Fedora’s near future, based on the recent discussions of these matters in the Fedora community.
