One of the best things about working on the Open Source and Standards (OSAS) team here at Red Hat is the sheer number of interesting people in open source that we get to work with and talk to every day. It seems a shame not to share some of those conversations with the rest of the community, so we've started **Upstream**, a podcast that features interviews and conversations with the people who're moving open source forward. 

For the first episode, I sat down with Leslie Hawthorn at the [Twelfth Annual Southern California Linux Expo](http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale12x) (SCALE 12x), to talk about her Sunday morning keynote "Why Checking Your Privilege is Good For *You*". 

Please give it a listen, and let us know what you think. Have suggestions for future guests? Drop us a note in the comments. We hope you enjoy listening as much as we're enjoying putting these together.
