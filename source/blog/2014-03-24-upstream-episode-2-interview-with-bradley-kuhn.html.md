Here's the long-awaited second installment of the Upscale podcast. Long-awaited in no small part because it's taken a little longer than it should to do the editing and put it online! But it's well worth the wait, we promise. In this episode I talk to Bradley Kuhn of the [Software Freedom Conservancy](http://sfconservancy.org/)(SFC).

Kuhn and I sat down for a few minutes at the 12th annual [Southern California Linux Expo](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale12x)(SCALE 12x), and had quite a good conversation about what the SFC is doing these days, the push for a free software accounting system that can be used by non-profits, and much more.
