![](blog/rdo-logo.png) For the first year and a half, [RDO](http://openstack.redhat.com/) has been largely an effort run by Red Hatters, with some of the work going on behind the firewall. In our community meetup in Paris, at the OpenStack Summit, as I mentioned in my [earlier post](http://community.redhat.com/blog/2014/12/rdo-packaging/), we got a lot of feedback from people saying that they wanted greater insight into what we were doing, as well as the opportunity to play along.

So I wanted to quickly update with some of the things that we're doing in RDO to "swim upstream" a little more.

## CentOS Cloud SIG

The [CentOS Cloud SIG](http://wiki.centos.org/SpecialInterestGroup/Cloud) is moving along, although officially still in the "getting started" phase. We've started having weekly meetings on IRC, on the #centos-devel channel on Freenode. Those meetings are at 15:00 UTC every Thursday. (`date -d "15:00 UTC"` in your favorite shell will translate that to local time for you.) Have a look at the [minutes from our most recent call](http://www.centos.org/minutes/2015/january/centos-devel.2015-01-15-15.02.html) and plan to attend the next one.

The Cloud SIG isn't just RDO, though. It also incorporates work in the Eucalyptus community, and other cloud provider projects have expressed interest, too.

## RDO Packaging Meetings

In addition to the work that's happening in the CentOS Cloud SIG, there's also the RDO-specific work that happens outside of CentOS, and for that we have a bi-weekly meeting where you can find out what's happening, and where you can get involved. These happen on the #rdo channel on Freenode IRC, every other Wednesday, also at 15:00 UTC. You can see the [minutes from the most recent meeting](http://meetbot.fedoraproject.org/rdo/2015-01-21/), and we hope to see you at the next one.

## FOSDEM

And, on the same subject, if you plan to be at FOSDEM next week, RDO will be represented at the [CentOS dojo](http://wiki.centos.org/Events/Dojo/Brussels2015). Haikel Guemar will be leading a demo of the RDO Quickstart, where you can see, and play along, as he deploys OpenStack on CentOS 7. If you're planning to attend, Haikel offers the following advice:

> In order to run the tutorial on your machine, we recommend a VM on your laptop that has 20GB+ of disk space, 2GB of ram and atleast 1 dedicated cpu core. If your laptop has the ability to run nested-virt, please enable that and use it. It will make a large difference to performance of the overall setup. We would also like to request everyone to setup these VMs ahead of time, in either KVM or Xen or any other virtualisation technology you might use. A basic CentOS-7 minimal install is sufficient to start from.

## Come swim with us

There are lots of places where you can get involved in OpenStack. We'd love to have you participate in what we're doing at RDO. Come along to one of the meetings, and see if there's something you can contribute to the effort. Although we're heavily Red Hat at the moment, we really want participation from the broader community of Fedora and CentOS users.

We hope to see you soon.
