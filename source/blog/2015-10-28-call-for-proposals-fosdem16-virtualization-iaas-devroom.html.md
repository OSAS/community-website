![FOSDEM logo](blog/fosdem2015.png) I am excited to announce that the call for proposals is now open for the Virtualization & IaaS devroom at the upcoming [FOSDEM 2016](https://fosdem.org/2016/).

This year will mark FOSDEMâ€™s 16th anniversary as one of the longest-running free and open source software developer events, attracting more than 5,000 developers and users from all over the world. It will be held once again in Brussels, Belgium, on January 30 & 31, 2016.

This devroom is a collaborative effort, and is organized by dedicated folks from projects such as OpenStack, Xen, Mesos, oVirt, and Foreman. We would like to invite all those who are involved in these fields to submit your proposals by December 1st, 2015.

## About the Devroom

The Virtualization & IaaS devroom will feature session topics such as open source hypervisors and virtual machine managers such as KVM, Xen, bhyve, and VirtualBox, and Infrastructure-as-a-Service projects such as Apache CloudStack, OpenStack, oVirt, OpenNebula, and Ganeti.

This devroom will host presentations and labs that focus on topics of shared interest, such as KVM, libvirt, shared storage, virtualized networking, clustering and high availability, interfacing with multiple hypervisors, and scaling across hundreds or thousands of servers.

Presentations in this devroom will be aimed at developers working on these platforms who are looking to collaborate and improve shared infrastructure or solve common problems. We seek topics that encourage dialog between projects and continued work post-FOSDEM.

## Important Dates

**Submission deadline:** 1 December 2015<br>
**Acceptance notifications:** 10 December 2015<br>
**Final schedule announcement:** 17 December 2015<br>
**Devroom:** 30-31 January 2016 (two days)

## Submission Guidelines

* We expect more proposals than we can possibly accept, so it is vitally important that you submit your proposal on or before the deadline. Late submissions are unlikely to be considered.

* All presentation slots are 45 minutes, with 35 minutes planned for presentations, and 10 minutes for Q&A.

* All presentations **will** be recorded and made available under Creative Commons licenses. In the Submission notes field, please indicate that you agree that your presentation will be licensed under the CC-By-SA-4.0 or CC-By-4.0 license and that you agree to have your presentation recorded. For example:

> "If my presentation is accepted for FOSDEM, I hereby agree to license all recordings, slides, and other associated materials under the Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike 4.0 International License. Sincerely, \<NAME\>."

* In the *Submission notes* field, please also confirm that if your talk is accepted, you **will** be able to attend FOSDEM and deliver your presentation. We will not consider proposals from prospective speakers who are unsure whether they will be able to secure funds for travel and lodging to attend FOSDEM. (Sadly, we are not able to offer travel funding for prospective speakers.)

## Submit Your Proposal

All submissions must be made via the [Pentabarf event planning site](https://penta.fosdem.org/submission/FOSDEM16). If you have not used Pentabarf before, you will need to create an account. If you submitted proposals for FOSDEM in previous years, you can use your existing account.

After creating the account, select Create Event to start the submission process. Make sure to select **Virtualization & IaaS devroom** from the Track list. Please fill out all the required fields, and provide a meaningful abstract and description of your proposed session.

## Call for Volunteers

We are also looking for volunteers to help run the devroom. We need assistance watching time for the speakers, and helping with video for the devroom. Please contact [Mikey Ariel](mailto:mariel@redhat.com) for more information.

## Questions?

If you have any questions about this devroom, please send your questions to our [devroom mailing list](mailto:iaas-virt-devroom@lists.fosdem.org). You can also subscribe to the list to receive updates about important dates, session announcements, and to connect with other attendees.
