![oVirt logo](blog/oVirt-logo.png) With [FOSDEM 2016](https://fosdem.org/2016/) just a few short weeks away, here are all the details about our community activities during the conference.

As previously mentioned in [this blog post](http://community.redhat.com/blog/2015/12/fosdem16-virt-iaas-devroom-schedule-published/), the devroom schedule is available on the [FOSDEM website](https://fosdem.org/2016/schedule/track/virtualisation_and_iaas/). We have some great presentations from our community members, with something for everyone to learn from and enjoy throughout both days of the conference.

## oVirt/Foreman Stand

This year we will share a stand with our friends from [the Foreman project](http://theforeman.org/). Stop by to say hello, grab swag, and enjoy some cool live demos!

### Stand Volunteers Wanted!

If you're attending FOSDEM and would like to help us out, we'd love to have you there! This is a great opportunity to introduce oVirt to FOSDEM attendees and meet other community members from all over the world.

Special surprise swag is reserved for booth volunteers! Please sign up for booth shifts in this [etherpad page](http://etherpad.ovirt.org/p/ovirt-fosdem-2016) (lines 11-33). One of our core contributors will also be at the booth to support and co-pilot each shift.

## Social Event on Saturday

In previous years, we held informal social gatherings for our community members on Saturday evening. These evenings are yet another excellent opportunity to meet and chat with the oVirt community outside the hectic FOSDEM venue.

This year we'd like to hold an event again if there is enough demand, so please write your name in the [etherpad page](http://etherpad.ovirt.org/p/ovirt-fosdem-2016) (line 86 and down) by **January 15**.

If there is enough interest, we will reserve a nice pub in the center of Brussels and buy the first round. Final confirmation about the event will be published one week before the conference.

See you in Brussels!
