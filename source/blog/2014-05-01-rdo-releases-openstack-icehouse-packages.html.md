[OpenStack Icehouse](http://openstack.org/icehouse), the ninth release of the OpenStack cloud platform, rolled out on April 17, and on April 29 (Tuesday), the RDO release manager Pádraig Brady [announced the availability of the RDO packaging of Icehouse](https://www.redhat.com/archives/rdo-list/2014-April/msg00105.html) on the rdo-list mailing list.

RDO is a packaging of upstream OpenStack for easy deployment on CentOS, Fedora, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Because deploying OpenStack can be such a challenge, RDO greatly simplifies this using Puppet scripts and a quick three-step process to getting up and running &ndash; just follow the [Quick Start Guide](http://openstack.redhat.com/Quickstart).

We're very excited about the new features in the Icehouse release &ndash; more than 350 new features, developed by more than 1,200 contributors &ndash; and the new incubated projects that are going to make OpenStack even better in future releases. And we're proud to be a [leader in making those changes happen](http://activity.openstack.org/dash/releases/index.html?data_dir=data/icehouse).

Come talk with us at the [OpenStack Summit](/events/2014/#openstacksummitus) about how you're using OpenStack in your organization, and to see how you can get involved in the [RDO project](http://openstack.redhat.com/).

The [OpenStack Summit](https://www.openstack.org/summit/openstack-summit-atlanta-2014/) will be held May 12-16 in Atlanta.
