Just in case you've missed it, the [CentOS](http://www.centos.org/) team [announced the general availability](http://lists.centos.org/pipermail/centos-announce/2014-July/020393.html) of the first CentOS-7 release.

This is the first major release from the CentOS Project since it [joined forces with Red Hat](http://community.redhat.com/blog/2014/01/red-hat-and-centos-join-forces/), and it's pretty exciting to see what the team has accomplished so far. 

This is, however just the beginning. As the announcement email from Karanbir Singh notes plans to expand the CentOS "portfolio" to Docker images, cloud images, a minimal install ISO for CentOS 7, and (potentially) builds for 32-bit x86, ARM, and PowerPC. There's also work going on in Special Interest Groups around Xen, storage, and [Atomic](http://projectatomic.io/).

Information on the images is available [on mirror.centos.org](http://mirror.centos.org/centos/7/isos/x86_64/0_README.txt), you can choose the full DVD, a GNOME or KDE Live image, a Netinstall image, or "everything" ISO with all packages for CentOS 7. See the announcement email for links to the torrents for the various images (with SHA sums as well to verify the images).

Congrats to the CentOS team for the first major CentOS-7 release!
