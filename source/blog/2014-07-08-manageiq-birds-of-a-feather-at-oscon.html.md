Not long after announcing the formation of the [ManageIQ](http://manageiq.org/) community at OpenStack Summit, the project released a series of [YouTube HowTo videos](https://community.redhat.com/blog/2014/06/master-manageiq-with-helpful-howto-videos/). 

This month, OSCON attendees can learn more about ManageIQ at the [Taming Hybrid Clouds with ManageIQ](http://www.oscon.com/oscon2014/public/schedule/detail/37708) birds of a feather (BoF) session on Tuesday, July 22nd. If you want to use cloud APIs in applications, or want a single management interface for cloud and virtualization platforms, you should make sure to attend.

BoF attendees will learn how to use ManageIQ as a single API and gateway for cloud workloads, and how ManageIQ works with AWS, VSphere, RHEV/oVirt, OpenStack, Hyper-V, and more.
