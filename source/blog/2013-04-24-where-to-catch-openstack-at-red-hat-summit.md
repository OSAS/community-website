If you're planning to come to Red Hat Summit next month, you'll have plenty of chances to [learn more about OpenStack](http://www.redhat.com/summit/sessions/topics/openstack.html) in 12 sessions on various aspects, including:


### Introduction to Red Hat OpenStack


Red Hat has contributed to OpenStack for more than a year, and is committed to releasing a commercial product based on the project. In this session, Chuck Dubuque and Gerry Riveros will provide an overview of Red Hat OpenStack and detail:



	
  * How Red Hat OpenStack is different from community distributions

	
  * Red Hat’s OpenStack strategy

### OpenStack: Core Components & Capabilities


OpenStack complements Red Hat’s cloud products by enabling enterprises and service providers to build an open source Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) platform.
