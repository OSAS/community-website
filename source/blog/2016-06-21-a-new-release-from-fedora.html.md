![Fedora logo](blog/fedora-logo.png) Today is the day that [Fedora 24 has been released](https://fedoramagazine.org/fedora-24-released/)!

It's kind of a big deal at Red Hat, since Fedora is the upstream from which many things flow. So, as such, it's a community release that gets a lot of attention both within Red Hat, and without.

I actually had the opportunity to clean-install Fedora 24 Beta last week&mdash;not that I am some Fedora &uuml;ber-fan or anything. No, this was a necessity brought on by a dead hard drive. Thank goodness for cloud backups... one new drive later and I was installing Fedora 24 from a live USB.

The experience itself was nothing notable, in that I had enough bad experiences with Xconfigurator and snapping CRT monitors to still make my subconsciously twitchy whenever I do a full install. Silly, yes, but I was poor in those days. So "not notable" is high praise indeed.

If you weren't aware, Fedora comes in three distinct releases, each maintained by workgroups in the Fedora community: [Workstation](https://getfedora.org/workstation/), [Server](https://getfedora.org/server/), and [Cloud](https://getfedora.org/cloud/).

I opted, as usual, for the Workstation release, which features GNOME 3.20 and, if you want to try it the X replacement Wayland. (X is still installed by default.) Working with the interface is a pure joy, I have to say, with excellent keyboard shortcut support that I have really come to appreciate lately. Not reaching for the mouse all the time is a blessing to this, er, *distinguished* man's wrists.

App support and installation is great, and I am looking forward to the implementation of Flatpak (n&eacute;e xdg-app), which was not formally included in the Fedora 24 release today, but was [released on its own on the same day](https://fedoramagazine.org/introducing-flatpak/). I don't need multiple Linux distros as much anymore now that I am not a reviewer and tech journalist, but I feel like firing up some virtual machines with other distros running so I can see Flatpak in action.

Speaking of VMs, I will probably be loading up additional machines on my [oVirt](http:www.ovirt.org) server soon for the Server and Cloud releases to start exploring those.

Circumstances afford me the opportunity to fresh-install Fedora 24, but if you are running Fedora 23, [you can easily upgrade you system today](https://fedoramagazine.org/upgrading-fedora-23-workstation-to-fedora-24/).

It has been said that Fedora 24 is an "interim" release, on its way to a new generation of Linux distribution that will highlight modularity, flexibility, and security.  After working with the latest the Fedora Project has to offer, I would say that Fedora 24 stands on its own as a powerful platform to get things done wherever your jobs are.
