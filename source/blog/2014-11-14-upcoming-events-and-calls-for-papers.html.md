![](blog/luggage.jpg) Doing exciting work with open source cloud, containers, virtualization, or other interesting technologies? Want to show it off to other folks in the FOSS community from around the world? Then don't miss these opportunities to get the word out about your work! 

## Linux.conf.au Clouds, Containers, and Orchestration Miniconf

[Linux.conf.au](http://linux.conf.au/) is consistently a fantastic event. Year after year it delivers a great selection of talks and miniconferences. This year I'm running the **Clouds, Containers, and Orchestration** miniconf, and looking for presentations by **November 25th**. Here's the short synopsis:  

```
"Software-defined everything," DevOps, and cloud are driving open source further and faster than we might have imagined possible just a decade ago. Most recently, Docker containers and orchestration have opened up all kinds of new opportunities to develop, deploy, and manage software from the developer's desktop well into production.

Some of the other notable Devrooms include the ever-popular Distributions Devroom, Network management and SDN, Legal and policy issues, configuration management, testing and automation, and many more. 


## DevConf.cz

Just a few days from FOSDEM, and a hop, skip, and jump over to Brno â€“ [DevConf.cz](http://www.devconf.cz/) will be bringing about 1,000 developers, quality engineers, system administrators, and users from the Fedora, JBoss, and Red Hat communities. 

The DevConf.cz [call for participation](http://www.devconf.cz/cfp) is open through December 1st. 

## See you there!

Even if you're not speaking at one of these events, we hope to see you at Linux.conf.au 2015, FOSDEM, and DevConf.cz. Keep an eye on this space for updates on the programs and other interesting events coming in 2015.
