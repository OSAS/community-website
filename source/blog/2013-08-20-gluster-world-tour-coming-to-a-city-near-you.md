If you’ve been watching the [Gluster Community Day Meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/Gluster/) page, you’ve noticed lots of activity lately. That’s because we are planning several of these around the world, in addition to a few others we’ve already run this year.

What is a ‘Gluster Community Day?’ It’s a day for in-depth sessions, use cases, demos, and developer content presented by Gluster Community experts representing many layers of today’s cloud and data center infrastructure. A Gluster Community Day is where you learn best practices for deploying, managing and developing with GlusterFS as well as [many of the adjunct projects](https://forge.gluster.org/) that make up the Gluster Community.

We have several upcoming, and many more that we’re planning. Below is a list of those that we have locked in – check back at gluster.org/meetups/ or meetup.com/Gluster to always see the latest list:

	
  * [August 27 – San Francisco](http://www.meetup.com/GlusterFS-Silicon-Valley/events/124722542/) – Rackspace has generously agreed to host this Community Day

	
  * [September 4 – Stockholm, Sweden](http://red.ht/11JazeE) – Our first event in the nordic region!

	
  * [September 10 – London, England](http://www.meetup.com/Gluster/London-GB/986272/) – Continuing the Northern road show

	
  * [September 19 – New Orleans, Louisiana](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/linuxcon-north-america/program/co-located-events) – Co-located with LinuxCon/CloudOpen North America

And we’re actively seeking venues in Germany, France, Netherlands, Hong Kong, Singapore, Seoul, Bangalore, Chennai and Taipei. If you’d like to submit a venue for consideration, please send it to cfp (at) gluster.org

Would you like to speak at one of the events above? Send a brief note to cfp (at) gluster.org with a title and brief description of what you would like to speak about. Also include your personal bio, including talks you’ve given at other events.

Look forward to seeing you there!
