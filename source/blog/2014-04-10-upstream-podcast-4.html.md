In our fourth episode, Joe Brockmeier talks to Shane Curcuru, Vice President of Brand Management for the [Apache Software Foundation](http://www.apache.org/) (ASF). Joe tracked down Shane at [ApacheCon North America 2014](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apachecon-north-america) in Denver to discuss brand management and trademarks. In this interview, Shane explains the importance of branding your project, and how Apache deals with trademarks differently than other open source projects do.
