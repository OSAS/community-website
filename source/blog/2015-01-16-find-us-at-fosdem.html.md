![](blog/fosdem2015.png) At the end of the month, more than 5,000 people from around the world will gather in Brussels for [FOSDEM 2015](https://fosdem.org/2015/) ( January 31 and February 1). The event is free and registration is not required, so if you're in the area (or can get there), FOSDEM is a great way to expand your international network *and* your skillset. 

The [schedule is now online](https://fosdem.org/2015/schedule/), but check back before the event to confirm that talks and speakers haven't been shifted around at the last minute. Here is a sample of sessions you can attend to learn more about our projects:

* Arik Hadas will explain [how to move virtual machines to oVirt](https://fosdem.org/2015/schedule/event/v2v/), and he'll provide a preview of the upcoming integration with virt-v2v.
* Attend [Federico Simoncelli](https://twitter.com/simon3z)'s talk to find out about the ongoing effort to [integrate oVirt virtualization and Gluster storage](https://fosdem.org/2015/schedule/event/hyperconvergence/) resources in single commodity boxes that can scale horizontally. 
* Federico will also give a talk on [Docker integration in oVirt and IaaS](https://fosdem.org/2015/schedule/event/dockerovirt/).
* Do you want to learn about [smart virtual machine scheduling in an oVirt cluster](https://fosdem.org/2015/schedule/event/smartvmsched/)? If so, check out Roy Golan's talk. 
* Find out about [utilizing NUMA architecture in oVirt](https://fosdem.org/2015/schedule/event/numaovirt/) by attending [Doron Fediuck](https://twitter.com/doron_f)'s session.
* [Niels de Vos](https://twitter.com/nixpanic) will provide [an overview of GlusterFS](https://fosdem.org/2015/schedule/event/glusterfsoverview/) and discuss future directions for the project.
* Do you want to learn about [CentOS SIGs](http://community.redhat.com/blog/2014/10/CentOS-SIGs-update/)? Check out the [CentOS Virt SIG talk](https://fosdem.org/2015/schedule/event/immutable/) by George Dunlap.
* [John Mark Walker](https://twitter.com/johnmark) will explain how to control all of the things in his [What You Can Do with Open Source Cloud Management (and ManageIQ)](https://fosdem.org/2015/schedule/event/whatmanageiq/) talk.

These are only a few of the many great sessions at FOSDEM 2015. Check out the event website to see what else is going on and who will be there at: [https://fosdem.org/2015/](https://fosdem.org/2015/)
