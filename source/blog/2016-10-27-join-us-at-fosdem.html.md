![fosdem Logo](blog/fosdem2015.png) The [Free and Open Source Developer European Meeting](http://fosdem.org) (FOSDEM) conference will be held once again in Belgium at the Universite Libre de Bruxelles on February 4 & 5, 2017. For those not familiar with the event, it’s the largest general open source conference in Europe&mdash;perhaps the largest in the world&mdash;taking place annually in Brussels since 2001. (And, if you want to get pedantic about it, you could say FOSDEM was born in 2000 as the [OSDEM conference](https://fosdem.org/2017/about/).)

The conference has always been an important one for Red Hatters, with our employees representing the community in several ways:  teaching in the exhibition area, giving talks as part of the main program, organizing of FOSDEM itself and organizing Developer Rooms. This year is no exception, as you can see from all the Developer Rooms we’re helping to organize!

Developer Rooms are community-organized content tracks focusing on particular topics, such as Legal & Policy in FOSS or Linux Distributions. Running in parallel to the main track conference sessions, these breakout spaces allow open source projects or individuals interested in topic areas to convene, network, and learn from one another.

This year, we’re excited to be involved in 12 of the more than 30 Developer Rooms planned for FOSDEM 2017.  We’re hoping to see old friends at FOSDEM&mdash;and make many more new ones&mdash;so we hope you’ll submit to one or more of these open Calls for Papers:

* **[Cloud & Monitoring](https://lists.fosdem.org/pipermail/fosdem/2016-October/002490.html)**&mdash;Automating cloud deployments, monitoring containerized services, #monitoringlove and more….
