The RDO community is pleased to announce the general availability of the RDO build for OpenStack Mitaka for RPM-based distributions - CentOS Linux 7 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux. RDO is suitable for building private, public, and hybrid clouds and Mitaka is the 13th release from the [OpenStack project](http://openstack.org), which is the work of more than 2500 contributors from around the world.

The [RDO community project](https://www.rdoproject.org/) curates, packages, builds, tests, and maintains a complete OpenStack component set for RHEL and CentOS Linux and is a founding member of the [CentOS Cloud Infrastructure SIG](https://wiki.centos.org/SpecialInterestGroup/Cloud). The Cloud Infrastructure SIG focuses on delivering a great user experience for CentOS Linux users looking to build and maintain their own on-premise, public or hybrid clouds.

All work on RDO, and on the downstream release, Red Hat OpenStack Platform, is 100% open source, with all code changes going upstream first.

For a complete list of what's in RDO, see [the RDO projects yaml file](https://github.com/redhat-openstack/rdoinfo/blob/master/rdo.yml).

## Getting Started

There are three ways to get started with RDO.

To spin up a proof of concept cloud, quickly, and on limited hardware, try the [RDO QuickStart](http://rdoproject.org/Quickstart)  You can run RDO on a single node to get a feel for how it works.

For a production deployment of RDO, use the [TripleO Quickstart](https://www.rdoproject.org/tripleo/) and you'll be running a production cloud in short order.

Finally, if you want to try out OpenStack, but don't have the time or hardware to run it yourself, visit [TryStack](http://trystack.org/), where you can use a free public OpenStack instance, running RDO packages, to experiment with the OpenStack management interface and API, launch instances, configure networks, and generally familiarize yourself with OpenStack

## Getting Help

The RDO Project provides a Q&A service at [ask.openstack.org](http://ask.openstack.org), for more developer oriented content we recommend joining the [rdo-list mailing list](https://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/rdo-list). Remember to post a brief introduction about yourself and your RDO story. You can also find extensive documentation on the [RDO docs site](https://www.rdoproject.org/documentation).

We also welcome comments and requests on the [CentOS Mailing lists](https://lists.centos.org/) and the CentOS IRC Channels ( #centos on irc.freenode.net ), however we have a more focused audience in the RDO venues.
