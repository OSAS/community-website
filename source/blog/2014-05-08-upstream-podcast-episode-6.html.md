In this episode of *Upstream*, I talk with Marvin Humphrey from the Apache Software Foundation.  


We had a chance to chat at ApacheCon North America, earlier this year in Denver. Marvin had given a talk on [Releasing Apache Software](http://apacheconnorthamerica2014.sched.org/event/3a6199d909bbcbfa54b86f937522d184?iframe=no#.U2uyrXVdXKQ), which managed to make a fairly dry topic very engaging. He'd also recently completed a stint as the V.P. of the Apache Incubator and is the founder of [Apache Lucy](http://lucy.apache.org/), a "loose C" port of [Apache Lucene](http://lucene.apache.org/). 

We touch on all those topics, and a few more, in this podcast. At just under eight minutes, it's perfect for listening to when you have a few minutes to spare.
