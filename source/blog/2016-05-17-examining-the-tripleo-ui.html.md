![RDO logo](blog/rdo-logo.png) One of the very first things I learned about OpenStack was just how difficult it was to install.

With so many components handling so much automation, installation and deployment of a cloud computing platform like OpenStack, it's no small feat to get it up and running.

Luckily, a couple of years ago, the TripleO project started within the OpenStack community. [TripleO](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/TripleO) is a program aimed at installing, upgrading, and operating OpenStack clouds using OpenStack's own cloud facilities as the foundations. Designed to fix what has been perceived as one of OpenStack's biggest problems, TripleO builds with Nova, Neutron, and Heat to automate fleet management all the way up to datacenter scale.

Recently, a new video was released by the TripleO team's Jira Tomášek that demonstrates an OpenStack deployment using the TripleO user interface.

Watch the video and see how easy it can be to get OpenStack going.
