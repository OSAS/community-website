![](blog/scale13x.png) Once again, we're pleased to be running Infrastructure.Next events in Ghent and alongside the [Southern California Linux Expo](http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/13x). Tickets for [Ghent](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/infrastructurenext-ghent-2015-tickets-15221705531) and [SCALE](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/infrastructurenext-scale-2015-tickets-15330608262) are available now on Eventbrite, don't miss out! 

This is our second year running Infrastructure.Next. We had a great turnout last year, and are building on the previous events with feedback from last year's event. This year we'll have more case studies and deep dives, less introductory content. 

Naturally, we're also going to spend some time talking about Linux containers, so you'll be able to get your Docker on and hear about how containers fit into the picture today &ndash; and where they'll be tomorrow. We'll be featuring talks on:

 * Docker
 * Project Atomic
 * OpenStack
 * Ansible

And, of course, we'll be discussing how you can use these tools together and get the most out of open source in your environment. 

## Schedule to Come

We're still putting the last touches on the schedule. But, as with last year, we've got a stellar line-up of speakers ranging from ones who are in the trenches on some of the most relevant open source projects, to folks working in today's data center. We'll have a focus on clouds, orchestration, and containers this year &ndash; so if Docker is on your radar, or if you're interested in setting up a private cloud, you won't want to miss this event.
