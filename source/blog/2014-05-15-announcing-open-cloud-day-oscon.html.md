<img src="http://community.redhat.com/images/blog/oscon-logo.jpg"> Red Hat, along with Chef, Citrix, and the OpenStack Foundation, are sponsoring [Open Cloud Day](http://www.oscon.com/oscon2014/public/cfp/337) at OSCON on Monday, July 21st. 

The Open Cloud Day at OSCON is a look at the “state of cloud” in 2014, gathering industry practitioners to give their take on the state of public and private cloud, IaaS, and PaaS platforms, and where the industry is going in 2014 and beyond.

Whether it's Software Defined Networking (SDN), Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), Docker Containers, or how to write apps that scale, you'll find it at Open Cloud Day. 

## Call for Presentations

The Call for Presentations (CfP) is now open, until May 27th at 11:59 p.m. PDT. (The O'Reilly folks are *very* precise.) We're looking to have an overwhelmingly awesome lineup for Open Cloud Day, so if you’re passionate about the open cloud, transforming the data center, and have a great story or best practice to share, we want to hear from you.

Talks should be vendor-neutral, and straight to the point. Each speaker will have 30 minutes to connect with an audience of developers making the next generation of scale-out applications on software-defined infrastructure.

## Join us at OSCON

We're really excited to be part of the OSCON program. Come [join us in Portland](https://en.oreilly.com/oscon2014/public/register), OR, on July 21st and help make the Open Cloud Day something to remember.
