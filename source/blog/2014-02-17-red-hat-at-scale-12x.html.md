[![](blog/scale12x.png)](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale12x)[FOSDEM](http://fosdem.org/) is a wonderful conference, but if you're going to plan an event for the colder months (at least in the Northern Hemisphere), why not do it somewhere warm? Like sunny Los Angeles? That's a tiny part of the appeal behind [the Southern California Linux Expo](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale12x) (SCALE), now going strong in its 12th year. 

The weather, of course, is only a small (but undeniable) slice of the appeal to SCALE. What brings in droves of developers, admins, and enthusiasts is the unbeatable slate of [speakers](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale12x/speakers) with outstanding [talks](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale12x/schedule), [special events](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale12x/events), and more. 

## Special Events

Speaking of special events, you won't want to miss [Infrastructure.Next @ SCALE](http://lanyrd.com/2014/infra-at-scale/). 

Note that anyone attending SCALE is welcome to attend some/all the talks, but we do ask that folks register so we have an idea of attendance. See the schedule at the end of this post.

## Don't Miss Talks

SCALE is full of awesome talks you don't want to miss. Lawrence Lessig kicks off the conference Friday night with the opening keynote, "[Only You Can Get This, So Where Are You?](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale12x/presentations/opening-keynote-only-you-can-get-so-where-are-you)" from 9:00 p.m. to 10 p.m. A bit late for a keynote, but who'd want to miss it?

Some of the other talks you don't want to miss:

- Jason Hibbets: [Open Source ALL The Cities](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale12x/presentations/open-source-all-cities)
- Rich Bowen: [Demystifying mod_rewrite](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale12x/presentations/demystifying-modrewrite)
- Thomas Cameron: [Next Generation High Availabilty Linux Clustering](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale12x/presentations/next-generation-high-availabilty-linux-clustering)
- Karsten Wade: [CentOS Project Q&A](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale12x/presentations/centos-project-qa-forum)
- Ruth Suehle: [Raspberry Pi Hacks](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale12x/presentations/raspberry-pi-hacks)
- Joe Brockmeier: [Understanding Software Collections](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale12x/presentations/understanding-software-collections)
- Jason Brooks: [How to Assemble A Cutting Edge Cloud Stack With Minimal Bleeding](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale12x/presentations/how-assemble-cutting-edge-cloud-stack-minimal-bleeding)

And that's just a handful of the talks you don't want to miss. Not to mention the exhibit hall where you'll find all sorts of interesting stands. Red Hat and Fedora will have booths, as well as plenty of other interesting projects and exhibitors. Come for the weather, stay for the awesome. See you at SCALE!
