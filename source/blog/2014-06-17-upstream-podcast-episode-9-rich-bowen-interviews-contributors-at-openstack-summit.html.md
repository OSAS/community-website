[Rich Bowen](https://twitter.com/rbowen) spent a little time last month at the [OpenStack Summit in Atlanta, GA](https://www.openstack.org/summit/openstack-summit-atlanta-2014/), and had a chance to catch up with some of the upstream contributors to OpenStack. 

In this short podcast, you'll hear from several OpenStack contributors directly from the show floor at OpenStack Summit.
