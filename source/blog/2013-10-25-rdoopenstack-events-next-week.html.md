We've got two RDO events next week you'll want to put on your calendars.

On Tuesday and Wednesday (October 29th and 30th) we'll be doing another [RDO Test Day](http://openstack.redhat.com/RDO_Test_Day_October_2013), where we'll be putting the Havana release through its paces. We'd really appreciate a few hours of your time to help make sure that the new release is solid.

Then, on Thursday (October 31st), at 4pm GMT, Brent Eagles will giving a talk about more advanced networking techniques on OpenStack, including GRE Tunnels and VLANs. You can sign up on the [Google Hangout](https://plus.google.com/events/cfgnq5t8it7uvksrtpd00s2fcmg), and attend online.

Come join the conversation on the [RDO Forum](http://openstack.redhat.com/forum/), or on the [#rdo channel](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=rdo) on the Freenode.net IRC network.
