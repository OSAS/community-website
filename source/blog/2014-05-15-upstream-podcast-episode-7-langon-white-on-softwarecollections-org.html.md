<img src="http://community.redhat.com/images/blog/upstream-mic.jpg"> At Red Hat Summit 2014, Joe Brockmeier caught up with Langdon White, Developer Evangelist for Red Hat Enterprise Linux. 

Langdon talks about SoftwareCollections.org, which was created to give the community a way to participate around the upstream of the Red Hat Enterprise tool chain. In this interview, Langdon discusses what software collections are and when you'd want to use them.
