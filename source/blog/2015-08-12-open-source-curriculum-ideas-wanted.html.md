![IFL logo](blog/IFL-Santa-Cruz-logo.png) Recently I’ve begun volunteering at [Idea Fab Labs here in Santa Cruz](https://santacruz.ideafablabs.com/), with two specific goals — expanding the space to include free/open source software ethos and hacking, and helping all these awesome makers with questions and reality around the open source way.

*Tip — I got quite fired-up to do this from [Ruth Suehle’s keynote at SCALE this year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1FBGWrX_n0), so go watch that if you need any reason why you should be helping maker spaces and friends with your open sourcery.*

On the first goal, I’m working up a space in the fab labs — similar to the 3D printing, CNC router, laser cutter, jewelry zone, electronics, etc. spaces — goal is to have a place to drop in and do real software hacking; teach others from the bottom all the way up on how and why to contribute; or, yeah, even freaking care about open source software.
