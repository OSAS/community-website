![OpenNFV logo](blog/opnfv_logo.jpg) With the changing economics due to the ubiquity of mobile data and triple-play home broadband offerings, the telecommunications industry is undergoing a massive change. Operators and cable companies are moving from providing services to users with custom built hardware platforms to doing so with virtual services, running on a private cloud platform and commodity hardware.

The change has been coming for a while, but has gathered momentum in the past two years. The creation of the OPNFV initiative in October 2014 represented a big step forward, with a cross-section of the industry, including operators, network equipment providers, hardware and software platform vendors getting together to agree on priorities, use-cases and gaps which existed in state of the art open source components.

Building on projects like OpenStack, OpenDaylight, Open vSwitch, DPDK and the Linux kernel, the OPNFV community has taken on the challenge of producing a complete NFV platform built on standard upstream open source
components.

At FOSDEM 2016, I will deliver a presentation titled "[How to run a Telco on Free Software](https://fosdem.org/2016/schedule/event/telco_on_free_software/)," tracing the history of NFV, and the challenges in using a standard open source stack to run network functions which bring to the table strict latency and reliability constraints.
