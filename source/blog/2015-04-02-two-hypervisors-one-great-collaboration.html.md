![Xen-KVM logo](blog/Xen-KVM.jpg) Born in the logic of ones and zeroes and forged in the heat of battle, two hypervisors–sworn foes in the realm of virtualization–are about to unite in a way many never thought possible. Over beer and code.

Join the teams behind [Xen Project Developer Summit](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/xen-project-developer-summit/program/about) and [KVM Forum](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/kvm-forum) in Seattle as they co-host a social event that will rock the virtualization world. On August 18, 2015, at the close of the Xen Project Developer Summit and on the eve of KVM Forum, attendees of both events can come together and collaborate in the best way possible: with crudites and hors d’oeuvres (and beer).

Virtualization is one of the most important technologies in IT today, so it makes perfect sense for the two best hypervisor projects to collaborate and socialize at an event that celebrates their similarities and bridges that gap between all things KVM and Xen.

The party will get started Tuesday, August 18, at a time and location to be announced shortly! Attendees of both conferences are welcome to come and join the fun and be reminded of what open source is all about.

And before raising a pint to toast to friends both old and new, there’ll be an opportunity for some serious coding. So, if you’re a KVM contributor, a Xen zealot, or a power user of XenServer or oVirt, the joint KVM Forum and Xen Project Developer Summit Hackathon is the place to be during daylight hours.

The hackathon will be held on Tuesday, August 18, 2015, in the Virginia Room, 4th Floor, Union St. Tower of the Sheraton Seattle from 1:00pm to 5:00pm. Aiming to foster technical collaboration between the two best hypervisors in IT today, the event will enable participants to learn more about what makes each project work, as well as to delve into work on libvirt code that could bridge the gaps between Xen and KVM. Bring your laptops, your ideas, and your code and help improve open source virtualization for the good of both projects. Collaboration is what makes open source truly great, so come be a part of greatness.

And once the joint festivities are complete, you can participate in the KVM Forum itself, scheduled for August 19-21 at the Sheraton Seattle. Back in North America this year, the KVM Forum brings together the community of developers and users that define the KVM ecosystem for our annual technical conference.  We will discuss the current state of affairs and plan for the future of KVM, its surrounding infrastructure, and management tools. Also included will be sessions around oVirt and other KVM-based tools that enhance virtualization the datacenter. If you have a related topic on which you would like to present, submit an entry in the [CFP](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/kvm-forum/program/cfp), which closes on May 1.

We look forward to seeing you there!
