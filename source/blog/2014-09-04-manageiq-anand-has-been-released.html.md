ManageIQ is the world's leading open source cloud management platform. Use ManageIQ as your gateway to services running on public cloud infrastructure, such as AWS or OpenStack-based clouds, or private virtualization platforms such as VSphere, Hyper-V or RHEV/oVirt. The hybrid, open source nature of ManageIQ is why we call it "your gateway to the open cloud." ManageIQ ensures that the promise of the open cloud remains viable in today's competitive landscape.  

ManageIQ was once the eponymous proprietary product of a startup with a rich history in systems management. After acquisition by Red Hat, it was released under the CloudForms brand, with the intent of releasing it as an open source project and community. We launched the community back in June of this year, along with the first source code availability, and now we have the first release under our belts.

We're naming ManageIQ releases after chess grandmasters. Read about [Viswanathan Anand](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viswanathan_Anand), this release's namesake.

One of the great things about launching new communities is all of the first landmarks and milestones reached in a short period of time:

- Due diligence of code - Check
- Developer workflow completed - Check
- First web site - Check
- First source code availability - Check andâ€¦
- First GA community release - Check!

As of today, we can check off that last bullet with the release of ManageIQ Anand, the first open source GA release of ManageIQ. So what sort of features can you expect to see in this version?

- Supported providers: AWS, VMware VSphere, OpenStack, Microsoft SCVMM, RHEV/oVirt
- External auth (LDAP)
- Many, many fixes and rewrites to replace proprietary libraries in the older releases

We're on a 6-month release cycle, and the next release will be named "Botvinnik", named for [Mikhail Botvinnik](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Botvinnik). Botvinnik planning is taking place right now; take a look at the [blueprints currently under development](http://talk.manageiq.org/category/developers/blueprints).

Want to hear from developers and partners directly about what's happening with ManageIQ? Want to hear how others are using ManageIQ? Come to the first ever [ManageIQ Design Summit!](http://miqdevsummmit14.eventbrite.com/) We'll have a small, intimate gathering of ManageIQ developers and aficionados discussing, planning, and giving feedback for the ManageIQ community. Come one, come all.
