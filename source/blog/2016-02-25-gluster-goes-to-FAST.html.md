![Gluster logo](blog/gluster-ant.png) We hosted a small meetup/birds of a feather session at [USENIX’s FAST conference](http://usenix.org/conference/fast16/technical-sessions). FAST is a conference that focuses on File And Storage Technologies in Santa Clara, California.

Vijay Bellur, Gluster Project Lead, did a short talk on Gluster.Next, our ongoing architectural evolution in Gluster to improve scaling and enable new use cases like like storage as a service, storage for containers, and hyperconvergence.
