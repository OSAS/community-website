The community has been vital part of [oVirt](http://www.ovirt.org/Home) since its beginning. Recently, we started a new [community metrics page](http://www.ovirt.org/stats/), which gathers information on activity in the oVirt community.

The table below shows the total contributions for oVirt in March 2014 in terms of authors, commits, and mailing list particpants:

|                        | Contributors  | Commits   | Participants |
| ---------------------- | ------------- | --------- | ------------ |
| Red Hat Employees      | 57            | 754       | 58           |
| Community              | 20            | 81        | 130          |
| Total                  | 77            | 835       | 188          |
| Community % of total &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   | 26.0%         | 9.7%      | 69.2%        |

*oVirt Project Stats on 3/21/2014

March was a relatively busy month for the oVirt crew, what with getting [oVirt 3.4](http://www.ovirt.org/OVirt_3.4_Release_Notes) ready and all. We were happy to see a lot of new features in oVirt 3.4, with some contributed by developers outside Red Hat, including PPC64 support from IBM for both the oVirt engine and VDSM.

There is a perception out there that oVirt is a Red Hat-only project, but in reality there are many contributors and participants from the community who have contibuted code to oVirt: Intel, Dell, NetApp, and SUSE. 

Admittedly, there is a ways to go. Community diversity is a priority for oVirt, because it's not just enough that users experience this powerful datacenter management platform. We want as many people as possible involved to help make oVirt a better platform that will serve their needs and the broader user community.
