In this episode of Upstream, [Rich Bowen](http://twitter.com/rbowen) interviews [Ohad Levy](https://twitter.com/ohadlevy) of the [Foreman project](http://theforeman.org/). Levy discusses using Foreman to deploy OpenStack, and more! 

Currently, Levy is helping organize the [OpenStack Israel](http://www.openstack-israel.org/) event, which will be held June 2. The [Call for Papers](http://www.openstack-israel.org/#!copy-of-call-for-papers/cu3y) is now open.
