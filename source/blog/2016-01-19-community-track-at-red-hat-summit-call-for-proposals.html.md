This year at [Red Hat Summit](https://www.redhat.com/en/summit), we will have a track to highlight some of the excellent work being done in upstream communities that Red Hat participates in and sponsors. If you're working on, or using, one of our key projects we'd love to hear about it!

The Open Source and Standards (OSAS) team would like to feature interesting case studies that show how our communities are using projects like CentOS, Ceph, Fedora, Foreman, Gluster, oVirt, Project Atomic, RDO, and others. We're also interested in presentations that show off work happening in the upstreams, to demonstrate the innovation that happens first upstream.
