Now in its tenth year, [Google Summer of Code](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2014) (GSoC) is ramping up for 2014 students, and applications to participate must by submitted by March 21 at 19:00 UTC. This year Fedora, oVirt, and JBoss are included in the impressive list of [190 mentoring organizations](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/org/list/public/google/gsoc2014).Â 

## Fedora

For the ninth time, the Fedora Project is participating in GSoC. Fedora contributor Buddhike Kurera offers a preview of the project's 2014 ideas for GSoC students [on Fedora Magazine](http://fedoramagazine.org/preview-of-the-fedora-project-in-google-summer-of-code-2014/), and he encourages students to contribute their own ideas to [the list](http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Summer_coding_ideas_for_2014).

## oVirt

The oVirt team is excited to be involved with GSoC for the first time and [offered a preview](http://community.redhat.com/blog/2014/03/preview-of-ovirt-in-google-summer-of-code-2014/) of what they have planned on our blog. The team has been brainstorming ideas, but also encourages participating students to propose ideas that would fit within the mandate of creating a world-class datacenter virtualization environment or better the open source ecosystem as a whole.

## JBoss

The JBoss community also has been rounding up GSoC project ideas. Browse through the [JBoss Community Google Summer of Code 2014 Ideas](https://community.jboss.org/wiki/GSOC14Ideas?_sscc=t) page for an overview of the options, or create a free JBoss community account and [submit your own ideas](https://community.jboss.org/wiki/GSOC13StudentIdeas)

Only a few hours remain until the GSoC '14 application deadline. Find out more on the [Google Summer of Code 2014](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2014) site.
