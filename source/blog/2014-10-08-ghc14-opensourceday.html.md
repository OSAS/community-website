![](blog/ghc14.png)The 2014 [Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing](http://gracehopper.org/) is this week, October 8-10, in Phoenix, Arizona, with 8,000 attendees expected to converge on the annual event. Open source skills can give you a big advantage in the tech industry, so it's fitting that GHC '14 kicks off with a bunch of open source action. 

According to Priyanka Sarkar in a recent article on OpenSource.com, [FOSS Skills That Will Get You Hired This Year](http://www.opensourceforu.com/2014/05/foss-skills-will-get-hired-year/), candidates with OpenStack, web and mobile app development, and programming experience, for example, are in demand. These are a few of the areas that will be covered in Wednesday's [Grace Hopper Open Source Day](http://gracehopper.org/open-source-day/), which includes a Code-a-thon for Humanity as attendees pick up new (or improve current) open source skills. Registered code-a-thon attendees can choose to work with participating organizations, such as OpenStack. In the OpenStack workshop, for example, attendees with basic familiarity with SSH clients get a crash course in cloud computing, OpenStack, and how OpenStack is used in humanitarian apps.

In addition to the open source-focused workshops, GHC will have [101 Sessions](http://gracehopper.org/open-source-day/) this year, which are introductions for people who have little or no experience in open source. Pre-registration for 101 Sessions isn't required, but it's first come, first served if you want to learn about the [Chromium browser](http://www.chromium.org/), [FreeBSD](http://www.freebsd.org/), [GitHub](https://github.com/), the [Linux Foundation](http://www.linuxfoundation.org/), and [OpenHatch](https://openhatch.org/). 

If you're attending GHC '14, be sure to swing by the Red Hat booth in the career fair. See the [career fair guide](http://gracehopper.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/GHC2014-Career-Fair-Guide.pdf)(pdf) for the booth map, which you're going to need because there are lots of great booths to visit (Red Hat is booth #404).

If you can't attend GHC '14 in person, you can attend in spirit via the [Live stream](http://gracehopper.org/ghc-2014-livestream-schedule/) of keynotes and plenary events, see updates from the action on the [blog roll](http://ghcbloggers.blogspot.com/), and keep an eye on the official conference tweets by following #ghc14. See the [GHC Community Hashtags](http://gracehopper.org/ghc-community-hashtags/) page for a list of hashtags for specific sessions, too.
