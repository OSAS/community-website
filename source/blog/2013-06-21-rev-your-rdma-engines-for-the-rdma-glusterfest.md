UPDATE: We're extending testing until 00:00 UTC on Tuesday, June 25. We want to give everyone a chance to get their RDMA clusters set up.

It’s that time again – we want to test the [GlusterFS 3.4](http://www.gluster.org/2013/02/new-release-glusterfs-3-4alpha/) beta before we unleash it on the world. Like our [last test fest](http://www.gluster.org/2013/05/glusterfest-test-day-and-the-gluster-test-framework/), we want you to put the latest GlusterFS beta through real-world usage scenarios that will show you how it compares to previous releases.

This time around, we want to focus this round of testing on Infiniband and RDMA hardware.

For a description of how to do this, see the [GlusterFest page](http://www.gluster.org/community/documentation/index.php/GlusterFest) on the community wiki. Run the tests, report the results, and report any bugs you found as a result.

As an added bonus, use the [gluster-users mailing list](http://supercolony.gluster.org/mailman/listinfo/gluster-users) as another outlet for your testing. After reporting the results on the GlusterFest page, report them on the list, too, and other users can confirm – or counter – your results.

Find a new bug that is confirmed by the Gluster QE team, and I’ll send you a free t-shirt (see image below).

Testing is underway now, and wraps up at 00:00 UTC on Saturday, June 22 (aka 5pm PT/8pm ET on Friday, June 21).
