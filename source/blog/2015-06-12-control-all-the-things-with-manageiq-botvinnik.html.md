We're very happy to announce that ManageIQ Botvinnik is now [generally available](http://manageiq.org/download/). This marks the first full release cycle for ManageIQ as an open source project. As mentioned in previous announcements, we name our releases alphabetically after chess world champions. For the "B" release, we selected Mikhail Botvinnik, a Soviet chess champion from the 1950's. The "C" release cycle is named after Jose Raul Capablanca, a Cuban world chess champion from 1921-1927.

For the impatient, here's what you need to know:

*     View a [recent webinar about the Botvinnik release](http://www.slideshare.net/ManageIQ/botvinnik-webinar)
*     See the [changelog](https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq/blob/botvinnik/CHANGELOG.md)
*     [Download Botvinnik](http://manageiq.org/download/)
*     Read some [docs about using it for the first time](http://manageiq.org/documentation/top-tasks/)
*     Talk about it on [talk.manageiq.org](http://talk.manageiq.org/)
