[Bug 1,000,000](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1000000) was filed today by Anton Arapov in Red Hat's Bugzilla. The bug, an improvement request for the automatic bug detection and reporting tool (abrt), is a nice milestone just a few weeks ahead of the 15th anniversary of Bugzilla's first release.

The Bug #1 in Red Hat's Bugzilla is not publicly visible, but Bug #2 was [filed against the Red Hat Secure Web Server](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2) in November 1998. Even then, Red Hat was quick to jump on new and interesting open source technologies: the first Bugzilla release was in [August 1998](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/netscape.public.mozilla.announce/tSqoQduffps), just a few months before Red Hat started using the system.

_Technically_, it may not actually be the 1,000,000th bug, and it might be more accurate to say "issue" rather than bug. (There's apparently been a few issues skipping numbers at some point in the Bugzilla history.) Red Hat's Bugzilla is used to track bugs, feature requests, improvements, and so forth for Red Hat's products as well as many projects â€“ such as [Fedora](http://fedoraproject.org/), [GlusterFS](http://www.gluster.org/), [oVirt](http://www.ovirt.org/Home), and many others. Still, it's a good time to take a moment and marvel at just how many issues have been tracked and resolved in Red Hat's little corner of the open source world.

It's even _more_ impressive when you note that [Bug #500,000](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=500000) was filed just over four years ago. (Also closed by Anton Arapov, interestingly enough...) Seems likely that we'll be seeing Bug 2,000,000 in no time at all. Keep 'em coming!
