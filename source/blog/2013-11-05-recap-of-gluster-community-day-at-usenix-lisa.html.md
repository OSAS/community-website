![orange-ant-250px](blog/orange-ant-250px-150x150.png) Yesterday we had the opportunity to run a Gluster Community Day atÂ [USENIX LISA](https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa13) in Washington D.C. Turns out it was well worth the time, as we had a fantastic group turn up for some really excellent talks.

The crowd wasn't large, but it was clearly a group that was interested in GlusterFS and [associated projects](https://forge.gluster.org/), like [puppet-gluster](https://forge.gluster.org/puppet-gluster). Having the right crowd is almost always better than having a big, but disinterested, crowd.

Planned to write up a post to summarize the event, but it looks like James Shubin has beaten me to the punch with a fantastic post on [The Technical Blog of James](http://ttboj.wordpress.com/2013/11/05/gluster-community-day-lisa-2013-monday/). Be sure to check out James' post, and if you're interested in Gluster, Puppet, and other technical goodness, put his blog's feed in your favorite reader. (He's also on [Twitter as @purpleidea](http://twitter.com/purpleidea).)

Many thanks to the attendees for turning up, and to Wesley Duffee-Braun, Eco Willson, and James for giving some fantastic talks and Gluster wisdom.

Don't forget, we also have a [Gluster Birds of a Feather (BoF)](https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa13/birds-feather-sessions#gluster) here at LISA on Thursday. Join us at 8:00 p.m. in the "Hoover" room.
