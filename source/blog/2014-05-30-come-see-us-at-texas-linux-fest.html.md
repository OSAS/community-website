[Texas Linux Fest](http://texaslinuxfest.org/) will be held June 13-14 in Austin, Texas at the [Austin Convention Center](http://texaslinuxfest.org/venue), and several Red Hatters will be on the scene. 

Friday from 8AM-12PM, TxLF attendees can learn about the upcoming RHEL 7 release in the [RHEL 7 and Beyond](http://texaslinuxfest.org/content/rhel-7-and-beyond) track. The agenda includes:

* RHEL 7 Deep Dive &ndash; Ben Breard
* RHEL 7 Performance Tuning &ndash; Larry Woodman
* Docker, [Project Atomic](http://www.projectatomic.io/), and OpenShift &ndash; Adam Miller
* Live Kernel Patching with kPatch &ndash; Seth Jennings

The exhibit show opens Friday at noon, so stop by the CentOS booth to learn more about the project and upcoming release. 

And on Saturday at 11:25AM, I'll be giving a talk on [What Communities Can Learn from Buffy the Vampire Slayer](http://texaslinuxfest.org/content/what-communities-can-learn-buffy-vampire-slayer). (Prior Buffy experience not required.)

I look forward to welcoming you all ...excuse me, y'all... to my adopted home city, beautiful [Austin, Texas](http://www.austintexas.org/).
