Last month at the [RDO meetup](https://www.rdoproject.org/forum/discussion/1018/rdo-meetup-openstack-summit-vancouver) in Vancouver, a number of topics were discussed. Jarda talked about [RDO-Manager](https://www.rdoproject.org/RDO-Manager), the installation and management tool based on [TripleO](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/TripleO). Here's just that part of the meeting.
