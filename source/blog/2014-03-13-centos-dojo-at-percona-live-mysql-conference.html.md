Monday, March 31st, is [Open Source Appreciation Day](http://www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2014/program/open-source-appreciation-day) at the [Percona Live MySQL Conference](http://www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2014/program/open-source-appreciation-day) at the Santa Clara Convention Center, and we're pleased to announce that we'll be running a [CentOS Dojo](http://wiki.centos.org/Events/Dojo/SantaClara2014) as part of the program.

Every Dojo is a bit different, but we always aim for useful talks with practical information on getting things done with (and on) CentOS and other open source solutions. Since we're co-locating with the Percona Live MySQL Conference, we've got several MySQL-related talks, and plenty of info on logging, metrics, and more. We've also got a peek into the future for folks ready to take a look at systemd, and an opportunity for Q&A on CentOS itself. 

## From systemd to MariaDB

The line-up for this event is top-notch, and if you're in the area you're *not* going to want to miss it. Here's what's planned, running from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.:

 * **The New CentOS Project** - Karsten Wade 
 * **Notes on MariaDB** - Michael 'Monty' Widenius 
 * **Running MySQL on CentOS Linux** - Peter Zaitsev
 * **On Logging** - Jordan Siessel 
 * **Software Collections on CentOS** - Joe Brockmeier
 * **Two Years in Your Future** - Joe Miller
 * **System Automation and Metrics at Pinterest** - Jeremy Carroll

This promises to be an excellent progam with tons of tech tips, best practices, and industry insight you won't find at most conferences. 

## Sign Up and CentOS Discount

You can sign up **free** for the CentOS Dojo on [Eventbrite](http://www.eventbrite.com/e/percona-live-mysql-conference-and-expo-santa-clara-april-1-4-2014-tickets-8111067421), but tickets are limited and going fast. If you'd like to attend the entire conference, the code "CentOS" will net you a 15% discount. 

## More to Come!

The Santa Clara Dojo is just one of several we have coming up very soon. We've got a [mile-high CentOS Dojo](http://wiki.centos.org/Events/Dojo/Denver2014) coming up on April 10th &ndash; just after [ApacheCon North America](http://na.apachecon.com/) and during the [CloudStack Collaboration Conference 2014](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/cloudstack-collaboration-conference-north-america). 

For our European friends, we'll be hosting a [CentOS Dojo in Lyon, France](http://wiki.centos.org/Events/Dojo/Lyon2014) at Epitech on April 11th. You won't want to miss this if you are nearby.
