Yesterday, Dave Neary gave an introductory talk on networking for OpenStack admins. Billed as being a talk for people that don't know much about networking, Dave covered some of the basic elements of routing, and how to make it work in a SDN (Software Defined Networking) environment on Openstack.

You can watch the talk on YouTube:
