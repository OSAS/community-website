If you live in, around, or near Cincinnati, Ohio, then come join us on June 4th at the [University of Cincinnati's School of Information Technology](http://cech.uc.edu/it.html) for a [one-day CentOS Dojo](http://wiki.centos.org/Events/Dojo/Cincinnati2014).

Never been to a Dojo before? Here's what to expect: the CentOS Dojos are one-day events to bring together people from the CentOS communities to talk about systems adminstration, best practices, and emerging technologies of interest. We aim to bring together expert and local speakers to talk about the things that practicioners care about most, and to share stories from experiences working with CentOS in all kinds of scenarios.

## The Lineup

The day will start at 9:30 a.m. with a meet and greet for folks to get to know one another, then we jump into the program. We're still adding a few speakers, but the current schedule includes:

* Rich Bowen on **Measuring your OpenStack Cloud with Ceilometer**
* Joe Brockmeier on **Software Collections on CentOS**
* Shaun McCance on **Open Source Documentation for Admins**
* Russ Pavlicek on **Using and Understanding Xen4CentOS**
* Jim Perrin on **Growing CentOS as a Platform for Infrastructure Development**

And a few more really interesting presentations that will be announced soon. Don't delay signing up, though. Space is limited, and the Dojos are intentionally kept small so we can have good and effective conversations between speakers and the audience, and to allow attendees to introduce themselves and network with other folks at the Dojos.

Special thanks to the University of Cincinnati for hosting the event! We're looking forward to seeing you on June 4th.
