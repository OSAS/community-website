* ManageIQ BoF on Monday, May 18: [A Tour of ManageIQ Botvinnik](http://sched.co/3Gyp) - What's new in the upcoming Botvinnik release? Find out here
* [OpenStack Infrastructure Management with ManageIQ](http://sched.co/2qh1), John Hardy, Product Manager, Red Hat - Learn about hybrid cloud management from a guy who could write books about it
* [ManageIQ User Day @ OpenStack Summit](http://sched.co/3HFm) - Learn how to use ManageIQ with OpenStack in a scale-out lab setting.
