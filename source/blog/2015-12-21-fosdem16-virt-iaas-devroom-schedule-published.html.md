![bookshelves](blog/fosdem2015.png) The organizing team of the Virtualization & Infrastructure-as-a-Service devroom at the upcoming FOSDEM 2016 in Brussels is pleased to announce the talk selection process is complete and the session schedule is now available on the [FOSDEM website](https://fosdem.org/2016/schedule/track/virtualisation_and_iaas/).

This year will mark FOSDEM’s sixteenth anniversary as one of the longest-running free and open source software developer events, expected to attract more than 5,000 developers and users from all over the world. It will be held once again in Brussels, Belgium, on January 30 & 31, 2016.

READMORE

This devroom is a collaborative effort, organized by dedicated folks from projects such as [KVM](http://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Main_Page), [oVirt](http://www.ovirt.org/Home), [Xen](http://www.xenproject.org/), [RDO](https://www.rdoproject.org/), and [Atomic](http://www.projectatomic.io/). Presentations in this devroom will be aimed at developers working on these platforms who are looking to collaborate and improve shared infrastructure or solve common problems.

We’d like to thank everyone who submitted proposals to the devroom. Although we couldn’t fit all of the great proposals into the schedule, we’re confident that the schedule will have something for everyone in the Virt and IaaS fields.

## Call for Volunteers

We’re still looking for volunteers to help the devroom run as smoothly as possible! Whether this is your first FOSDEM or if you’ve volunteered at FOSDEM every year, your help will be invaluable. We’re especially looking for people to assist with operating the video equipment, but also folks who can help with crowd control, time-keeping, and so on.

If you are interested, please subscribe to our [devroom mailing list](mailto:virt-iaas-devroom@lists.fosdem.org) and introduce yourself, listing your availability and the role for which you’d like to volunteer. Volunteer shifts will be allocated by mid-January.
