[![](blog/rdo-logo.png)](http://openstack.redhat.com/) A year ago today &ndash; April 15, 2013 &ndash; [we announced](http://www.redhat.com/about/news/press-archive/2013/4/red-hat-advances-its-openstack-enterprise-and-community-technologies-and-roadmap) the [RDO](http://www.redhat.com/products/enterprise-linux/openstack-platform/) effort. We started the project in an effort to make it less painful to deploy an OpenStack cloud on CentOS, Fedora, or Red Hat Enterprise Linux. A lot has changed over the past year, but our mission remains the same.

We've grown from a handful of people to more than 2,000 people registered on the [forum](http://openstack.redhat.com/forum/) and wiki. We've also got a following on Twitter and Google+, and an active group of experts fielding questions on the [ask.openstack.org](https://ask.openstack.org/en/questions/) Q&A website.

In that time, Red Hat participation in the OpenStack project has grown, too, with Red Hat being the top contributor to the OpenStack code in the Folsom, Grizzly, Havana and (so far) Icehouse releases.

In the coming year, we're looking forward to Juno and whatever the [K release](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Release_Naming) ends up being called, and the innovation around cloud computing. We're hoping for — and working toward — big strides in ease of deployment and configuration, better metering, and all sorts of other improvements. Want to get the latest on RDO?
