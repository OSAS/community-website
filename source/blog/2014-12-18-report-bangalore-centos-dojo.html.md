![](blog/CentOS_200x.png)Planning for the [CentOS Dojo Brussels](http://wiki.centos.org/Events/Dojo/Brussels2015) event next month is underway and organizers are still [lining up talks](http://lists.centos.org/pipermail/centos-promo/2014-December/001492.html). The dojo will be held on January 30th at IBM Client Center Brussels (yes, that's right before [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/2015/) kicks off). If you're interested in speaking, contact the [centos-promo@centos.org](mailto:centos-promo@centos.org ) mailing list. Keep an eye on the [CentOS wiki events](http://wiki.centos.org/Events) page to see what other 2015 events are in the works.

The Red Hat Bangalore office hosted the first [CentOS Dojo in India](http://wiki.centos.org/Events/Dojo/Bangalore2014) last month. [Lalatendu Mohanty](https://twitter.com/lalatenduM) helped organize the dojo and he posted an [event report](http://lalatendumohanty.wordpress.com/2014/12/17/bangalore-centos-dojo-2014/) on his blog, so check it out. 

Although the Bangalore CentOS Dojo talks were not recorded, the project's [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheCentOSProject) does have recordings from other 2014 events.
In addition to the YouTube channel, you can follow CentOS on Twitter at [@CentOS](https://twitter.com/centos) and learn more about the dojos by following [@CentOSEvents](https://twitter.com/centosevents).
