Many thanks to [Rackspace](http://www.rackspace.com/) for agreeing to host our next Community Day in San Francisco! This day will feature in-depth sessions, use cases, demos, and developer content presented by Gluster Community experts.

This full-day, free Community Day features in-depth sessions, use cases, demos, and developer content presented by Gluster Community experts. This is a chance for developers to hear first-hand what GlusterFS and related open software-defined storage projects in the Gluster Community can accomplish in cloud and virtualized environments.

The sessions include: The State of the Gluster Community; Whatâ€™s New in GlusterFS 3.4; All About Geo-replication; and Adventures in Cloud Storage: Converged Infrastructure with cloud, GlusterFS and Virtualization. Plus, there will be demos and end user stories from operators deploying GlusterFS in production environments.

Please join us on August 27 at Rackspace's San Francisco office at 620 Folsom St., Ste. 100. Please RSVP at our [meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/GlusterFS-Silicon-Valley/events/124722542/) page. See you there!
