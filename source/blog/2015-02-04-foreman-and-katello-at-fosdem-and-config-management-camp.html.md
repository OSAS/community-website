![](blog/fosdem-foreman.png) The [Satellite team](https://access.redhat.com/blogs/1169563) spent the first parts of February meeting and working
with users of their upstream projects [Foreman](http://theforeman.org/learn_more.html) and [Katello](http://www.katello.org/).

We started the week in Brussels at [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org). As a
first time attendee, I was impressed with how many passionate open
source developers were at this conference. Danial Lobato ([@eLobatoss](https://twitter.com/eLobatoss)) gave talks on how developers could contribute to Foreman, and then showed how to use Katello and Foreman together to manage and deploy Docker containers. Petr Chalupa ([@pitr_ch](https://twitter.com/pitr_ch)) discussed improvements in concurrent-ruby based on his work in Foreman.

The real action was in the central hall. The team commandeered some
booth space and spent two days meeting with users. They answered
questions, showed future features, and helped to debug issues in running systems. The team topped off the two days with a community dinner at [Drug Opera](http://www.drugopera.be/) in the lower town. The community discussed things ranging from UI improvements to strategies to tie pony tails with only one hand.

The team then moved on to Ghent, to attend [Config Management Camp](http://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/). This is a two-day conference that brings users and developers of configuration management tools from around the world. Foreman was the third most requested room, and it was busy the whole weekend. Ohad Levy ([@ohadlevy](https://twitter.com/ohadlevy)) organized two great days of talks
in the [Foreman room](http://lanyrd.com/2015/cfgmgmtcamp/schedule/?spaces=rcgyz). After two days, we were glad to be heading home, but energized by such a strong community.
