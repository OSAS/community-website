![Summit logo](blog/bkp/Redhat-Summit.png) As Red Hat preps for [Red Hat Summit](https://www.redhat.com/en/summit) in the venerable Moscone Center next month, the Open Source and Standards team is preparing to be a strong presence at the event with our Community Central in the Main Expo Hall and a separate Open Source and Community track within the sessions.

The Community Central area will feature a lounge and plenty of space to interact with the Fedora and CentOS projects, which will anchor the space. But projects like [RDO](https://www.rdoproject.org/), [Gluster](https://www.gluster.org/), [Ceph](http://ceph.com/), [oVirt](https://ovirt.org), and [Project Atomic](http://www.projectatomic.io/) will also have a home in Community Central, just to name a few.

As mentioned before, Red Hat Summit will feature a stand-alone [Community track](https://rh2016.smarteventscloud.com/connect/search.ww#loadSearch-searchPhrase=&searchType=session&tc=0&sortBy=&p=&i(25608)=55529&i(28913)=67787), where attendees will learn about many of the projects in which Red Hat is involved, as well as get educated about best practices within the wider open source ecosystem.

I will let my colleagues talk up their respective projects' sessions, but I wanted to take a moment and highlight the sessions that our friends and colleagues from outside Red Hat are presenting in the Community track.

* **[Management, legal, and developers: One big happy open source family](https://rh2016.smarteventscloud.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=76015).** Our friend Deb Nicholson from the [Open Invention Network](http://www.openinventionnetwork.com/) will be teaming up with our own legal eagle Richard Fontana to discuss the legal ins and outs of working with free and open source software.

* **[Why companies should have open source strategy offices](https://rh2016.smarteventscloud.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=76016).** [SanDisk](https://www.sandisk.com/)'s Nithya Ruff will examine how open source strategy offices fit within a corporate world, and how her company got such a team started.

* **[Building the student pipeline to open source communities using HFOSS](https://rh2016.smarteventscloud.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=76014).** Hear Heidi Ellis of [Western New England University](https://wne.edu/) and Greg Hislop of [Drexel University](http://drexel.edu/) review an approach they have used in their classes for increasing the number of students who understand open source and are capable of contributing to open source projects such as [GNOME Accessibility](https://wiki.gnome.org/Accessibility), [OpenMRS](http://openmrs.org/), and [Ushahidi](https://www.ushahidi.com/).

* **[From open source toward open innovation: Fostering corporate innovation with open source communities](https://rh2016.smarteventscloud.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=76019).** Fellow Hoosier Sabine Brunswicker of [Purdue University](http://www.purdue.edu/) will guide attendees through very recent insights gained from a big data analysis focused on the inner working mechanism of the [OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/) community.

* **[Use Linux on your whole rack with RDO and open networking](https://rh2016.smarteventscloud.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=76017).** Friend of the team Scott Suehle from [Cumulus Networks]https://cumulusnetworks.com/ will demonstrate how open networking using Linux can help simplify and standardize your RDO deployment.

This is by no means all of the great content in the Community track, and there will be more upstream-oriented content throughout the Summit. We are looking forward to rolling out the red carpet for all of our guests at Community Central from June 28-30!
