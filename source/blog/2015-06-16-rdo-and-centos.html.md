Continuing in the series about the 
[RDO Meetup in Vancouver](https://www.rdoproject.org/forum/discussion/1018/rdo-meetup-openstack-summit-vancouver),
in this recording we have Karsten Wade, of the
[CentOS](http://centos.org/) project, talking about CentOS's
relationship with RDO, and with OpenStack in general. He talks about the
CentOS build infrastructure, CI, package repos, and the CentOS Cloud
SIG.
