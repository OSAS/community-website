In the open source software world, every day can be a test day, but there's plenty to be gained when community members converge on an IRC channel to nick themselves on a project's cutting edge.

This month, there's a handful of test days on tap:

*RDO: February 4th & 5th*

Following the OpenStack Icehouse milestone 2 release, the RDO project is holding a pair of test days on http://openstack.redhat.com/forum/discussion/965/icehouse-milestone-2-test-day-feb-4-5[February 4th and 5th]. For more information, and to indicate that you'll be participating, head to the http://openstack.redhat.com/RDO_test_day_Icehouse_milestone_2[test day page] on the RDO wiki.

*Gluster: February 14th - 16th*

The beta3 packages for Gluster 3.5 are expected to hit FTP this week, with a GlusterFest testing weekend to follow. This one is still somewhat TBD, so check http://www.gluster.org/[Gluster project site] and http://www.gluster.org/interact/mailinglists/[mailing lists] for updates and confirmation.

*oVirt: February 11th and February 19th*

http://community.redhat.com/blog/2014/01/ovirt-3.4-all-about-easier-installation-administration/[oVirt 3.4] is nigh, with a http://www.ovirt.org/OVirt_3.4_release_management[projected general availability] date of February 24th.

Leading up to the final 3.4 release, there's a pair of test days scheduled for shaking out as many issues as possible ahead of the release. For more information, see the http://www.ovirt.org/OVirt_3.4_TestDay[3.4 test days page] on the oVirt project wiki.

*Fedora QA Tips & Fedora.next*

The Fedora Project isn't holding any test days for February, due in part to a longer-than-normal lead-in period for http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Fedora.next[Fedora.next], an umbrella term for the "shape of Fedora in the post-F20 future."

However, Fedora QA titan Adam Williamson offered up a great list of https://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/test/2014-January/120167.html[suggested testing activities] during the pre-F21 lull that's well worth reading and acting on.

And, speaking of Fedora.next and Adam Williamson, Adam wrote a very https://www.happyassassin.net/2014/01/31/good-morning-bugfixing-and-thinking-about-fedora-next/[insightful post] about the new initiative and Fedora's near future, based on the recent discussions of these matters in the Fedora community.
