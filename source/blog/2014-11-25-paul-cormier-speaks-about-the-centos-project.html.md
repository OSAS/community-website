![](blog/CentOS_200x.png)When it comes to making sure people are happy and excited about [Red Hat joining forces with the CentOS Project](http://community.redhat.com/centos-faq/), one of the most important stakeholders inside of Red Hat is EVP & President of Products and Technologies, Paul Cormier. Paul should be familiar as the person who made the hard but important business decision that split the original Red Hat Linux in to Fedora Linux and Red Hat Enteprise Linux (RHEL). That move was the impetus for the creation of the CentOS Project, amongst others, in responding to the community-driven need for a slow-moving platform.

In [this video interview](http://www.serverwatch.com/server-trends/red-hat-pushes-forward-with-centos-video.html), Paul talks about how things are going since we announced that Red Hat was formally joining the project. Paul says, "I think it's been great for the community, I think it's been great for the CentOS guys, I think it's been great for us at Red Hat."

One of the questions asked of Red Hat folks about the relationship is, "OK, I see how the community benefits, but what is in it for Red Hat?"

"(F)or us, it's a way to give the development world a platform," Paul says, "to go off and do development of other pieces in open source."

This is exactly the problem the Open Source and Standards (OSAS) team at Red Hat set out to resolve:  providing a useful, popular, and complete platform for projects and users to target, for trying and developing open source solutions. We picked the CentOS Project for being useful and popular, and began scaling out the work the Project had already envisioned about being a complete platform.

Another question people often ask is, "How does this fit with selling RHEL?"

Paul answers this simply:

"We're an open source company ... we decided a long time ago if as a company, if you draw a line and say, everything below is open and everything above is closed, it just doesn't work, so we just don't draw the line."

It's similar to how Red Hat understands that open source software tends to be better than proprietary software, especially in areas of stability and security, as well as ubiquity. Part of the fun we get to have now with the CentOS Project is working to make it the most useful
