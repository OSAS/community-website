The Fedora folks[ unleashed the Heisenbug alpha on the world today](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/announce/2013-September/003182.html). The next Fedora release is shaping up nicely so far, and has some interesting new features and changes that will appeal to a wide range of users.

Desktop Linux users get a preview of the latest GNOME, KDE, and other free desktop alternatives, not to mention updates to many of your favorite desktop applications.

This release is also exciting because it's the first release that will be treating ARM as a primary architecture. There's so much going on in the ARM space, it's great to see Fedora pursuing the architecture for those interested in ARM. (Note that this isn't the first Fedora on ARM release, but it denotes extra emphasis on ARM. The [Fedora Wiki explains the difference between primary and secondary architectures](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Architectures#Primary_Architectures).)

Of course, Fedora 20 has [has more changes than we can go into here](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases/20/ChangeSet). But you'll find improvements in virtualization, new features for NetworkManager, Ruby on Rails 4.0, and [a lot more to enjoy](http://fedoramagazine.org/2013/09/announcing-the-release-of-fedora-20-alpha/).

Though not a feature, _per se_, it's also worth noting that Fedora 20 will be released near the 10th anniversary of the first Fedora release. It's amazing to see just how far the Fedora Project has come in the last 10 years, and how much potential the project has for the next decade.

Get the full scoop on Fedora 20 Alpha from the [Fedora Magazine post](http://fedoramagazine.org/2013/09/announcing-the-release-of-fedora-20-alpha/), and be sure to [give the alpha a test drive](http://fedoraproject.org/get-prerelease) to [report any bugs or issues that you find](http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/How_to_file_a_bug_report). Remember that this is not a stable release and it **will have bugs**, but the sooner they're reported, the better it is for the final release.
