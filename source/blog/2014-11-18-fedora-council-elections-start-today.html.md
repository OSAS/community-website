![](blog/fedora-logo.png) The [Fedora Project](http://fedoraproject.org) recently [changed its governance model](http://fedoramagazine.org/fedora-governance-proposal-approved/) and has begun to set up a [Council](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Council) that will replace the Fedora Board. 

As John Rose noted on *Fedora Magazine*, the Board is working on an orderly transition from the old model to the Council model, and part of that is electing two new members for the Council.

Voting is open to all Fedora Contributors. More details are available on the [elections page](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Elections). 

Note that Fedora uses range voting, which means you should vote for as many (or as few) candidates as you like. The candidate receiving the most votes will serve a full term; the runner-up will serve a half-term.
