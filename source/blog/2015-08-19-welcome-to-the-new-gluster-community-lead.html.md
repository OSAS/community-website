![Gluster logo](blog/antmascot.png) The Open Source and Standards team in Red Hat is very pleased to announce the addition of a new team member: Amye Scavarda, who will be taking the role of GlusterFS Community Lead.

Amye's journey to the [GlusterFS Project](http://www.gluster.org/) could arguably be said to have started when she turned away from Dreamweaver web technology in 2008 while working on large Department of Energy cleanup sites as a technologist. A Portland, OR resident, Amye was invited by a friend to look for solutions at the annual [Open Source Conference](http://www.oscon.com). It would be at OSCON that Amye would learn about the [Drupal](http://www.drupal.org) content management system.

GlusterFS is a scalable network filesystem that is the upstream for Red Hat Gluster Storage. With its broad and global community, GlusterFS has been a powerful voice in the storage ecosystem for quite some time. Amye's steps into the role of Community Lead is a strong fit for the skills she brings.

After becoming a website consultant focusing on Drupal-based solutions, Amye soon learned the attraction and strength that an open source community could provide to a project like Drupal. Embracing the open source way through project management and analysis, Amye was able to work on projects for a wide variety of clients including the United Nations and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.

Her previous work at [Acquia](https://www.acquia.com/) had her working with user communities of various skillsets, which  enabled her to immediately see the impact of her work, something she enjoyed immensely.

Amye's background in project management will serve her in good stead as the GlusterFS Community Lead, as she sees herself as a facilitator for the project, not a manager. Some of Amye's more immediate goals will include revitalizing the GlusterFS board, increasing community contributions, and helping the project figure out where it needs to go in a future that is ever-changing.

With the skills and energy Amye possesses, there is little doubt that GlusterFS' immediate future is looking much brighter.
