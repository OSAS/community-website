Despite a few hiccups in the live streaming and recording efforts at FOSDEM 2015, 402 talks were successfully recorded, 94 of which popped up in the [video archives](https://video.fosdem.org) this week. The archives also include recordings from past FOSDEMs (all the way back to 2005), so when you discover that you've been sitting at your computer for a few days, watching videos and tripping down memory lane, don't say I didn't warn you.

Here are a few of the many 2015 videos you might want to check out:

* [Foreman: Contributing to Foreman (where and how)](http://ftp.belnet.be/FOSDEM/2015/devroom-configuration_management/contributing_foreman.mp4)

* [CentOS: Community Build Service and Infrastructure](http://ftp.heanet.ie/mirrors/fosdem-video/2015/devroom-distributions/centos:_community_build_service_and_infrastructure.mp4)

* [CentOS Infra Revealed](http://ftp.heanet.ie/mirrors/fosdem-video/2015/devroom-distributions/centos_community_infra_revealed.mp4)

* [Retooling Fedora: Retrospective on Fedora 21 (and looking to 22)](http://mirror.as35701.net/video.fosdem.org//2015/devroom-distributions/retooling_fedora.mp4)

FOSDEM organizers are still editing and posting videos, so keep an eye on the [2015 video folder](https://video.fosdem.org/2015/) or check the [STATUS text file](https://video.fosdem.org/2015/STATUS.txt) for additions.
