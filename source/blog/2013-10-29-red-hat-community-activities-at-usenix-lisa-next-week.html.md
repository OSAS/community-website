![USENIX LISA '13](blog/lisa13_banner_lucky_125.png)USENIX LISA 13 is rapidly approaching. Now in its 27th year (!) the Large Installation System Administration (LISA) Conference is going to be held in Washington D.C. from November 3rd through 8th, with a number of activities and talks of interest to Red Hat communities.

First, on Monday, we have a [Gluster Community Day](https://glusterday-lisa.eventbrite.com/). It's free to attend, but seats are limited - so make sure to sign up right away. Note that you don't have to be attending the rest of LISA to attend.

We're also running two Birds of a Feather (BoF) sessions at LISA, and there's a community organized BoF that is also of interest:

	
  * **Fedora BoF:** on [Wednesday from 7:30 to 8:30](https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa13/birds-feather-sessions#fedora) in Lincoln 4

	
  * **GlusterFS: What's New in 3.4 and How GlusterFS Makes Life Easier for Admins:** on Thursday from 8:00 to 9:00 in Hoover

	
  * **Red Hat System Administrators BoF**: Wednesday from 7:30 to 8:30 in Thurgood Marshall North

There's also a Red Hat and a Fedora booth at LISA this year, come see us in 418 and 420. And don't miss the great talks at LISA given by Red Hatters, including:

	
  * **[Storage Performance Testing in the Cloud](https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa13/storage-performance-testing-cloud)**: Jeff Darcy

	
  * **[Hyperscale Computing with ARM Servers](https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa13/hyperscale-computing-arm-servers)**: Jon Masters

	
  * **[Secure Linux Containers](https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa13/secure-linux-containers-thu)**: Dan Walsh

See you in Washington, D.C.!
