After a brief discussion we thought it would make sense to make 
Springboard a living example of what it can do, thus I created a 
simple style for it, added some content to the front page and we
will be populating the blog with real news about what we are
doing, and the [Documentation](/documentation/) will contain actual
docs on how you can take advantage of Springboard (and Middleman) for
for your own project!

Real content is the best way to dogfood the project, so stay tuned!
